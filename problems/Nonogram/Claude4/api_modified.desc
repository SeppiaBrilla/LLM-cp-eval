**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need a 2D grid where each cell represents whether a tile is filled (1) or blank (0). Let's call this `grid[i,j]` with domain {0,1}.

2. **Input Parameters**: 
   - Grid dimensions (rows and columns)
   - For each row: a sequence of required consecutive block lengths
   - For each column: a sequence of required consecutive block lengths

3. **Constraints**:
   - Each row must contain the specified blocks in order, with at least one blank tile between consecutive blocks
   - Each column must contain the specified blocks in order, with at least one blank tile between consecutive blocks
   - The blocks must be consecutive (no gaps within a block)
   - Blocks must be separated by at least one blank tile

4. **Modeling Approach**:
   - Use regular expressions or automata to enforce the pattern constraints
   - For each row/column, the pattern is: (any blanks)(block1)(at least one blank)(block2)...(any blanks)
   - We can use MiniZinc's `regular` constraint with finite automata

5. **This is a satisfaction problem** - we want to find any valid arrangement that satisfies all row and column constraints.

**MiniZinc model:**

% Block lengths for each row and column
array[1..rows, 1..max_blocks] of int: row_blocks;
array[1..cols, 1..max_blocks] of int: col_blocks;

% Decision variables: 1 = filled tile, 0 = blank tile

    int: num_states = total_block_cells + num_blocks + 2;
