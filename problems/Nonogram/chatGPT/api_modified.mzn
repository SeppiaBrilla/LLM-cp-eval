Reasoning:

1. The facade is a grid of square tiles. Each tile is a binary decision variable: 0 for blank, 1 for filled with a stone panel.

2. The domain of each tile variable is {0, 1}.

3. The constraints are the patterns of consecutive stone blocks in each row and column. These patterns must be followed exactly, but the spacing between blocks is flexible. This can be modeled as a sequence constraint: for each row and column, the sequence of 1s (filled tiles) must match the given pattern.

4. Pre-filled tiles (if any) should have fixed values.

5. This is a satisfaction problem: the goal is to find a valid arrangement of tiles that satisfies all constraints, not to optimize any objective function.

6. A potential simplification is to ignore the blank tiles and only model the filled tiles. However, this would make the sequence constraints more difficult to encode, so it's probably not a good idea.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Facade design
% The facade is a grid of square tiles. Each tile is a binary decision variable: 0 for blank, 1 for filled with a stone panel.

% Parameters
int: n; % number of rows/columns
array[1..n] of set of int: row_patterns; % patterns for each row
array[1..n] of set of int: col_patterns; % patterns for each column

% Decision variables
array[1..n, 1..n] of var 0..1: tiles;

% Constraints
constraint
  forall(i in 1..n) (
    % Row constraints
    let {
      array[int] of var 0..n: row_blocks = [ sum(j in 1..n) (tiles[i, j] = 1) ]
    } in
    row_blocks = row_patterns[i]
  )
  /\ forall(j in 1..n) (
    % Column constraints
    let {
      array[int] of var 0..n: col_blocks = [ sum(i in 1..n) (tiles[i, j] = 1) ]
    } in
    col_blocks = col_patterns[j]
  );

% Solve
solve satisfy;
```

Note: This model assumes that the patterns are given as sets of integers, representing the lengths of consecutive blocks of filled tiles in each row and column. The model also assumes that the number of rows and columns is the same (n), but this can be easily changed if needed. The model does not include any constraints for pre-filled tiles, but these can be added as needed.
