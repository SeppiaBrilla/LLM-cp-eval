and column. The constraints are represented as sequences of numbers, where each number indicates the length of a consecutive block of shaded squares in that row or column. The challenge is to determine which squares to shade in order to satisfy all the constraints without any contradictions. The problem is that these puzzles can be quite complex and time-consuming to solve manually, especially for larger grids. Therefore, the task is to develop an algorithm that can automatically solve any given Nonogram puzzle efficiently and accurately.
