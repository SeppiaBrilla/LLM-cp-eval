Nonograms are a popular puzzle, which goes by different names in different countries. Solvers have to shade in squares in a grid so that blocks of consecutive shaded squares satisfy constraints given for each row and each column. The constraints are sequences of numbers that represent the lengths of consecutive shaded blocks in that row or column, and these blocks must be separated by at least one unshaded square.
