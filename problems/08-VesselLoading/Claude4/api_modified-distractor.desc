**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine the position of each artwork panel in the gallery. Since panels are rectangular and aligned with walls, each panel needs:
   - x-coordinate of its bottom-left corner
   - y-coordinate of its bottom-left corner
   - These coordinates must ensure the entire panel fits within the gallery bounds

2. **Domains**: 
   - Gallery dimensions define the bounds for positioning
   - Each panel has fixed width and height
   - Coordinates must be non-negative integers within gallery limits

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Non-overlap constraint**: No two panels can occupy the same space
   - **Boundary constraints**: Each panel must fit entirely within the gallery
   - **Distance constraints**: Panels of certain category pairs must maintain minimum separation (horizontally or vertically)
   - **Reserved space constraints**: Some areas of the gallery may be reserved and unavailable

4. **Objective Function**: This appears to be primarily a satisfaction problem (can all artworks be placed?) with a secondary optimization aspect (maximize aesthetic impact by positioning striking pieces near entrance/windows). We'll model this as a satisfaction problem first, with the option to add aesthetic scoring.

5. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Use 2D coordinate system with origin at gallery corner
   - Model distance constraints using Manhattan distance or separate horizontal/vertical distance checks
   - Reserved spaces can be modeled as forbidden rectangular regions

% Constraints

% 1. Artworks must fit within gallery bounds
constraint forall(i in 1..n_artworks) (
    x[i] + artwork_width[i] <= gallery_width /\
    y[i] + artwork_height[i] <= gallery_height
);

% 2. No overlap between artworks
constraint forall(i, j in 1..n_artworks where i < j) (
    x[i] + artwork_width[i] <= x[j] \/    % i is left of j
    x[j] + artwork_width[j] <= x[i] \/    % j is left of i
    y[i] + artwork_height[i] <= y[j] \/   % i is below j
    y[j] + artwork_height[j] <= y[i]      % j is below i
);

% 3. Distance constraints between artwork categories
constraint forall(r in 1..n_distance_rules, i, j in 1..n_artworks where 
    i != j /\ 
    ((artwork_category[i] = cat1[r] /\ artwork_category[j] = cat2[r]) \/
     (artwork_category[i] = cat2[r] /\ artwork_category[j] = cat1[r]))
) (
    % Minimum horizontal or vertical distance between artwork centers
    let {
        int: center_i_x = x[i] + artwork_width[i] div 2,
        int: center_i_y = y[i] + artwork_height[i] div 2,
        int: center_j_x = x[j] + artwork_width[j] div 2,
        int: center_j_y = y[j] + artwork_height[j] div 2
    } in (
        abs(center_i_x - center_j_x) >= min_distance[r] \/
        abs(center_i_y - center_j_y) >= min_distance[r]
    )
);

% 4. Artworks cannot overlap with reserved spaces
constraint forall(i in 1..n_artworks, r in 1..n_reserved) (
    x[i] + artwork_width[i] <= reserved_x1[r] \/   % artwork is left of reserved area
    x[i] >= reserved_x2[r] \/                      % artwork is right of reserved area
    y[i] + artwork_height[i] <= reserved_y1[r] \/  % artwork is below reserved area
    y[i] >= reserved_y2[r]                         % artwork is above reserved area

% Optional: Aesthetic impact optimization (commented out for satisfaction version)
% array[1..n_artworks] of int: visual_impact;  % Impact score for each artwork
% array[1..n_artworks] of int: entrance_x, entrance_y;  % Entrance/window positions
% var int: total_aesthetic_score = sum(i in 1..n_artworks) (
%     visual_impact[i] * (gallery_width + gallery_height - 
%                        abs(x[i] - entrance_x[i]) - abs(y[i] - entrance_y[i]))
% );
% solve maximize total_aesthetic_score;

solve satisfy;

% Output the positions
output [
    "Artwork " ++ show(i) ++ " placed at (" ++ show(x[i]) ++ ", " ++ show(y[i]) ++ ")\n"
    | i in 1..n_artworks
];
