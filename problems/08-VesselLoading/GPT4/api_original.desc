Reasoning:

1. **Decision Variables**: The decision variables in this problem are the positions of the containers on the deck. For each container, we need to decide its x and y coordinates on the deck. Let's denote these variables as `x[i]` and `y[i]` for the i-th container.

2. **Domains**: The domain of the x and y coordinates for each container depends on the dimensions of the deck and the dimensions of the container itself. The x coordinate can range from 0 to the width of the deck minus the width of the container. Similarly, the y coordinate can range from 0 to the length of the deck minus the length of the container.

3. **Constraints**: There are several constraints that need to be encoded:
   - **Non-overlapping constraint**: No two containers can overlap. This can be ensured by making sure that for every pair of containers i and j, either the x coordinate of i is greater than the x coordinate of j plus the width of j, or the x coordinate of j is greater than the x coordinate of i plus the width of i, or the y coordinate of i is greater than the y coordinate of j plus the length of j, or the y coordinate of j is greater than the y coordinate of i plus the length of i.
   - **Separation constraints**: Certain pairs of containers need to be separated by a minimum distance. This can be ensured by adding constraints that the distance between the x coordinates of the containers is greater than or equal to the required separation distance, and similarly for the y coordinates.

4. **Objective Function**: This is a satisfaction problem, so there is no objective function. The goal is simply to find a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.

5. **Modeling Choices**: One possible simplification is to assume that all containers have the same dimensions. This would simplify the constraints, but it might not be a realistic assumption. Another possible simplification is to ignore the separation constraints, but this would also make the model less realistic.
