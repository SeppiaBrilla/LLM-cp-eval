**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves packing rectangles (containers) into a larger rectangle (deck) without overlapping and with additional separation constraints based on container classes. The deck has a given length and width, and all containers are axis-aligned. Each container has a class, and for certain class pairs, there are minimum separation requirements in the x-direction (along the deck) and/or y-direction (across the deck).

2. **Decision Variables**: For each container, we need to assign bottom-left coordinates (x, y) such that the container fits within the deck. Thus, for each container i, we have:
   - x_i: the x-coordinate (along the deck length)
   - y_i: the y-coordinate (across the deck width)

3. **Variable Domains**: 
   - x_i must be in [0, deck_length - l_i] to ensure the container fits within the deck length.
   - y_i must be in [0, deck_width - w_i] to ensure the container fits within the deck width.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Within Deck**: Each container must be fully inside the deck.
   - **No Overlap**: For any two distinct containers, they must not overlap. This is enforced by ensuring that for each pair, either they are separated in the x-direction or in the y-direction.
   - **Separation Constraints**: For each pair of containers i and j, if the minimum x-separation for their classes is positive, then the x-intervals must be separated by at least that distance. Similarly for y-separation. These constraints are additional to no-overlap and ensure that certain class pairs maintain minimum gaps.

5. **Input Parameters**:
   - deck_length, deck_width: dimensions of the deck.
   - n: number of containers.
   - l, w: arrays of container lengths and widths.
   - c: array of container classes.
   - num_classes: number of distinct classes.
   - min_x_sep, min_y_sep: 2D arrays specifying minimum separations between class pairs in x and y directions.

6. **Model Type**: This is a satisfaction problem (checking feasibility), so no objective function is needed.
