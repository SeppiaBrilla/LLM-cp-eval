These problems have many practical applications in communications and electrical engineering. The objective is to construct a binary sequence Si of length n that minimizes the autocorrelations between bits. Each bit in the sequence takes the value +1 or -1, and the autocorrelation function R(k) = Σ(i=1 to n-k) Si × Si+k for lag k should be as close to zero as possible for all non-zero values of k, while R(0) = n. This is known as the binary sequence design problem or the low autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem.
