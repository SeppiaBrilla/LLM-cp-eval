**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis:** The problem involves finding a binary sequence S of length n, where each element S_i is either +1 (beat) or -1 (rest), to minimize the overall repetitiveness measure E. E is defined as the sum of squares of autocorrelations C_k for lags k from 1 to n-1, where C_k = ∑_{i=1}^{n-k} S_i · S_{i+k}. This is an optimization problem with the objective to minimize E.

2. **Decision Variables:** The primary decision variables are the sequence elements S_i for i = 1 to n, each with a domain of {+1, -1}. In MiniZinc, this can be represented as an array of variables with integer domain {-1, 1}.

3. **Domains:** Each S_i has a finite domain of {-1, 1}, meaning only these two values are allowed.

4. **Constraints:** The core constraints arise from the definition of C_k and E:
   - For each lag k from 1 to n-1, C_k is computed as the sum of products S_i · S_{i+k} for i from 1 to n-k.
   - E is the sum of C_k^2 for all k.
   - There are no explicit additional constraints on S from the problem statement, but the objective function E inherently penalizes repetitive patterns.

5. **Reinforcement Behavior Consideration:** The problem mentions that consecutive beats of the same type reinforce each other, leading to louder or softer passages, and the sequence should be "balanced and varied." While this could imply constraints on run lengths or balance between beats and rests, it is not quantified. Minimizing E naturally reduces self-similarity, including at lag 1 (consecutive beats), which should help avoid long runs and promote variety. Therefore, no additional constraints are added here, but the model can be extended if specific limits are provided.

6. **Objective Function:** The goal is to minimize E, which is a non-negative integer derived from the autocorrelations.

7. **Modeling Approach:** In MiniZinc, we will:
   - Declare n as a parameter.
   - Define an array S of decision variables with domain {-1, 1}.
   - Compute each C_k using a loop or comprehension.
   - Compute E as the sum of C_k^2.
   - Use `solve minimize E;` to find the optimal sequence.

8. **Efficiency Note:** The computation of C_k and E involves O(n^2) operations, which is feasible for small to moderate n but may be slow for large n. For larger instances, more efficient representations or solvers might be needed.

**MiniZinc Model:**
```minizinc
% Parameter: number of beats n
int: n;

% Decision variable: rhythm sequence S, with S[i] = +1 for beat, -1 for rest
array[1..n] of var -1..1: S;

% Autocorrelation at lag k: C_k = sum_{i=1}^{n-k} S[i] * S[i+k]
array[1..n-1] of var int: C;

% Objective: overall repetitiveness E = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C_k^2
var int: E;

% Constraints to compute C_k for each lag k
constraint forall(k in 1..n-1) (
    C[k] = sum(i in 1..n-k) (S[i] * S[i+k])
);

% Constraint to compute E
constraint E = sum(k in 1..n-1) (C[k] * C[k]);

% Solve: minimize E
solve minimize E;

% Output: display the sequence S and the value of E
output ["Sequence S = ", show(S), "; E = ", show(E)];
```

This model defines the problem as described, computing the autocorrelations and minimizing the sum of their squares. The sequence S is output along with the minimal E value. If additional constraints for balance or run lengths are needed, they can be incorporated by modifying the constraints section.
