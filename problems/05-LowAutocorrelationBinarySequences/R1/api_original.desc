**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:** The problem requires constructing a binary sequence of length \(n\), where each element \(S_i\) can be either \(+1\) or \(-1\). Thus, the decision variables are \(S_i\) for \(i = 0\) to \(n-1\).

2. **Domains:** Each \(S_i\) must belong to the set \(\{-1, +1\}\). In MiniZinc, this can be represented as a variable with domain `-1..1`.

3. **Constraints:** There are no explicit constraints on the sequence values beyond the domain restrictions. The problem is an optimization problem with an objective function to minimize.

4. **Objective Function:** The goal is to minimize \(E = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C_k^2\), where \(C_k = \sum_{i=0}^{n-k-1} S_i \times S_{i+k}\). This involves computing autocorrelations for each lag \(k\) from 1 to \(n-1\), squaring them, and summing the squares.

5. **Modeling Approach:** The objective can be directly computed using nested summations in MiniZinc. For each \(k\), compute \(C_k\) as the sum of products \(S_i \times S_{i+k}\) over valid \(i\), then square and sum over \(k\). The model uses integer variables for \(S_i\) to simplify multiplication and summation.

6. **Optimization:** This is a minimization problem, so the solver will search for the sequence \(S\) that minimizes \(E\). The model parameterizes \(n\) to allow for different sequence lengths.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Parameter: length of the sequence
int: n;

% Decision variables: sequence S of length n, each element in {-1, 1}
array[0..n-1] of var -1..1: S;

% Objective: minimize E = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C_k^2, where C_k = sum_{i=0}^{n-k-1} S[i] * S[i+k]
var int: E = sum(k in 1..n-1) (
    sum(i in 0..n-k-1) (S[i] * S[i+k])
) ^ 2;

% Solve to minimize E
solve minimize E;

% Output the sequence S and the objective value
output ["Sequence S = ", show(S), "\nObjective E = ", show(E)];
```
