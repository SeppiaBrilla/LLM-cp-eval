**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find a sequence S of length n, where each element S_i is either +1 (beat) or -1 (rest), that minimizes the overall repetitiveness E. E is defined as the sum of squares of autocorrelations C_k for lags k from 1 to n-1, where each C_k measures the similarity between the sequence and itself shifted by k beats.

2. **Decision Variables**: The sequence S is represented using Boolean variables B[i] for i=1..n, where B[i] = true corresponds to S_i = +1, and B[i] = false corresponds to S_i = -1. This avoids the need for integer variables with domains excluding 0.

3. **Autocorrelation Calculation**: For each lag k from 1 to n-1, C_k is computed as the sum of S_i * S_{i+k} over i=1 to n-k. Since S_i * S_{i+k} is 1 when S_i and S_{i+k} are the same (i.e., B[i] == B[i+k]) and -1 when they differ, C_k can be expressed as 2 * A_k - (n - k), where A_k is the number of indices i where B[i] == B[i+k] for i=1 to n-k.

4. **Objective Function**: E is the sum of C_k^2 for k=1 to n-1. Minimizing E reduces the repetitiveness of the rhythm.

5. **Modeling Choices**: Using Boolean variables for B and computing C_k directly from B comparisons simplifies the model. The output sequence S is derived from B during output to match the problem's Â±1 format.

6. **Constraints**: The model includes constraints to define C_k for each k and E based on the Boolean variables. No additional constraints are needed since the domain of B is already restricted.

7. **Output**: The solution outputs the sequence S as a list of +1 and -1 values.

**MiniZinc model:**
```minizinc
% Minimize repetitiveness in a rhythm pattern of n beats
% Each beat is either +1 (beat) or -1 (rest)
% Autocorrelation at lag k: C_k = sum_{i=1}^{n-k} S_i * S_{i+k}
% Overall repetitiveness: E = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C_k^2
% Objective: minimize E

% Decision variables: B[i] is true if beat at position i, false if rest
array[1..n] of var bool: B;

% Autocorrelation C_k for k=1..n-1
array[1..n-1] of var int: C;

% Constraint to compute C_k for each lag k
constraint forall(k in 1..n-1)(
    C[k] = 2 * sum(i in 1..n-k)(bool2int(B[i] == B[i+k])) - (n - k)
);

% Objective variable: E is the sum of squares of C_k
var int: E;
constraint E = sum(k in 1..n-1)(C[k] * C[k]);

% Minimize E
solve minimize E;

% Output the sequence S as +1 and -1
output [ "Sequence S = " ] ++ 
       [ if fix(B[i]) then "1" else "-1" endif | i in 1..n ] ++ 
       [ "\nE = " ++ show(E) ];
