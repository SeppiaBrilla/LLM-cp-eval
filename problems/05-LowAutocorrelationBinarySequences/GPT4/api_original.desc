Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The decision variables are the bits in the sequence, denoted as `S[i]` for `i` in `1..n`. Each `S[i]` can take a value of +1 or -1.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of each `S[i]` is {-1, 1}.

3. Constraints:
   - There are no explicit constraints in this problem. However, the autocorrelation `C[k]` for each `k` in `1..n-1` is defined as the sum of the product of `S[i]` and `S[i+k]` for `i` in `1..n-k`. This is not a constraint but a calculation that needs to be performed for each `k`.

4. Objective Function:
   - The objective function is to minimize the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations, denoted as `E`. `E` is defined as the sum of `C[k]^2` for each `k` in `1..n-1`.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - Since the autocorrelation `C[k]` is defined as a sum, it can be calculated using a `sum` expression in MiniZinc.
   - The objective function `E` is also a sum of squares, which can be calculated using a `sum` expression in MiniZinc.
   - The decision variables `S[i]` can be defined as an array of integers with a domain of {-1, 1}.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the length of the sequence
int: n;

% Define the sequence of bits
array[1..n] of var -1..1: S;

% Define the autocorrelations
array[1..n-1] of var int: C;

% Calculate the autocorrelations
constraint forall(k in 1..n-1) (
  C[k] = sum(i in 1..n-k) (S[i] * S[i+k])
);

% Define the objective function
var int: E = sum(k in 1..n-1) (C[k]^2);

% Minimize the objective function
solve minimize E;

% Output the sequence and the objective function value
output ["Sequence: " ++ show(S) ++ "\nObjective function value: " ++ show(E)];
```

This model will find a sequence of bits that minimizes the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations. The sequence and the objective function value are outputted at the end.
