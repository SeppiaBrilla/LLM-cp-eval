Reasoning:

1. **Decision Variables**: The decision variables in this problem are the rhythm sequence S, where each S_i can be either +1 (beat) or -1 (rest). The length of the sequence is n.

2. **Domains**: The domain of each S_i is {+1, -1}.

3. **Constraints**: There are no explicit constraints given in the problem description. However, the problem implicitly requires that the sequence S must be a valid rhythm sequence, i.e., it must consist of n elements, each of which is either +1 or -1.

4. **Objective Function**: The objective function is to minimize the overall repetitiveness of the rhythm, which is defined as E = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C_k^2, where each C_k = \sum_{i=1}^{n-k} S_i \cdot S_{i+k}.

5. **Modeling Choices**: Since the problem is about minimizing the repetitiveness of a rhythm sequence, it is a combinatorial optimization problem. We can model it as a binary integer programming problem, where each S_i is a binary variable that can take the value +1 or -1. The objective function can be modeled as a quadratic function of the decision variables.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the length of the rhythm sequence
int: n;

% Define the rhythm sequence as an array of integer variables
array[1..n] of var -1..1: S;

% Define the autocorrelation at each lag
array[1..n-1] of var int: C;

% Calculate the autocorrelation at each lag
constraint forall(k in 1..n-1) (
  C[k] = sum(i in 1..n-k) (S[i] * S[i+k])
);

% Define the overall repetitiveness of the rhythm
var int: E;

% Calculate the overall repetitiveness of the rhythm
constraint E = sum(k in 1..n-1) (C[k] * C[k]);

% The objective is to minimize the overall repetitiveness of the rhythm
solve minimize E;

% Output the rhythm sequence
output [ if S[i] = 1 then "beat" else "rest" endif | i in 1..n ];
```

This model will find the rhythm sequence that minimizes the overall repetitiveness of the rhythm, taking into account the autocorrelation at each lag. The output will be a sequence of "beat" and "rest" indicating the rhythm sequence.
