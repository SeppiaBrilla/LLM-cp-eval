Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The decision variables are the rhythm sequence S, where each S[i] can be either +1 (beat) or -1 (rest).

2. Domains:
   - The domain of each S[i] is {-1, 1}.

3. Constraints:
   - There are no explicit constraints in this problem. The rhythm sequence S can be any combination of beats and rests.

4. Objective Function:
   - The objective function is to minimize the overall repetitiveness of the rhythm, defined as E = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C_k^2, where each C_k = \sum_{i=1}^{n-k} S_i \cdot S_{i+k}.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - We can simplify the calculation of C_k by using a loop to iterate over the rhythm sequence S.
   - We can also simplify the calculation of E by using a loop to iterate over the values of C_k.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the number of beats
int: n;

% Define the rhythm sequence S
array[1..n] of var -1..1: S;

% Define the autocorrelation C
array[1..n-1] of var int: C;

% Calculate the autocorrelation C_k for each k
constraint forall(k in 1..n-1) (
    C[k] = sum(i in 1..n-k) (S[i] * S[i+k])
);

% Define the overall repetitiveness E
var int: E = sum(k in 1..n-1) (C[k] * C[k]);

% The objective is to minimize E
solve minimize E;

% Output the rhythm sequence S
output ["Rhythm sequence: "] ++ [show(S[i]) | i in 1..n];
```

This model will find the rhythm sequence S that minimizes the overall repetitiveness E. The rhythm sequence S is outputted as a string of +1's and -1's, representing beats and rests respectively.
