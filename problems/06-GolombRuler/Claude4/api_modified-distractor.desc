**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - Positions of beacons: We need variables for the position of each beacon along the path
   - Types of beacons: We need variables to assign a type to each beacon

2. **Variable Domains:**
   - Beacon positions: Non-negative integers, with the first beacon fixed at position 0
   - Beacon types: Integer values representing different beacon types (each with different costs and ranges)

3. **Key Constraints:**
   - First beacon must be at position 0
   - All pairwise distances between beacons must be unique (no two pairs can have the same distance)
   - Beacons must be ordered along the path (positions should be non-decreasing)

4. **Objective Function:**
   - This is an optimization problem where we want to minimize the total path length (position of the last beacon)
   - We also want to minimize beacon costs, but the problem emphasizes minimizing path length as the primary concern

5. **Modeling Choices:**
   - We'll use integer positions for simplicity
   - We'll need to define beacon types with associated costs and ranges
   - The unique distance constraint is the most complex - we need to ensure all pairwise distances are different
   - We can set reasonable upper bounds on positions to make the problem tractable

6. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The problem mentions beacon ranges and efficiency, but doesn't specify exact constraints on coverage
   - We'll model this as a cost minimization with the unique distance constraint as the primary structural requirement

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Signal Beacon Placement Problem
% Minimize path length while ensuring unique pairwise distances

% Parameters
int: m;  % number of beacons
int: max_pos = m * m;  % upper bound on positions
int: num_types = 3;  % number of beacon types

% Beacon type costs (higher type = higher cost but better range)
array[1..num_types] of int: beacon_cost = [1, 3, 5];

% Decision variables
array[1..m] of var 0..max_pos: pos;  % positions of beacons
array[1..m] of var 1..num_types: beacon_type;  % type of each beacon

% Constraints

% First beacon at position 0
constraint pos[1] = 0;

% Beacons must be ordered (non-decreasing positions)
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1)(pos[i] <= pos[i+1]);

% All pairwise distances must be unique
constraint forall(i, j, k, l in 1..m where i < j /\ k < l /\ (i != k \/ j != l))(
    pos[j] - pos[i] != pos[l] - pos[k]
);

% Optional: ensure beacons are not all at the same position (except first)
constraint forall(i in 2..m)(pos[i] > 0);

% Objective: minimize total path length (last beacon position) plus beacon costs
var int: total_cost = pos[m] + sum(i in 1..m)(beacon_cost[beacon_type[i]]);

solve minimize total_cost;

% Output
output [
    "Beacon positions: " ++ show(pos) ++ "\n" ++
    "Beacon types: " ++ show(beacon_type) ++ "\n" ++
    "Path length: " ++ show(pos[m]) ++ "\n" ++
    "Total beacon cost: " ++ show(sum(i in 1..m)(beacon_cost[beacon_type[i]])) ++ "\n" ++

];
