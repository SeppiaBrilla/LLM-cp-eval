**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine the positions of m beacons along a straight path. Let's call these positions `pos[1..m]` where `pos[1] = 0` (first beacon is always at position 0).

2. **Domains**: Since we want to minimize the total length and positions must be non-negative integers along a path, each position `pos[i]` should be a non-negative integer. The upper bound can be estimated conservatively - in the worst case, we might need positions up to some reasonable maximum.

3. **Constraints**: 
   - `pos[1] = 0` (first beacon at position 0)
   - `pos[i] <= pos[i+1]` for all i (beacons are ordered along the path)
   - All pairwise distances must be unique: for any two pairs of beacons (i,j) and (k,l), if (i,j) ≠ (k,l), then |pos[i] - pos[j]| ≠ |pos[k] - pos[l]|

4. **Objective Function**: This is an optimization problem where we want to minimize the total design length, which corresponds to minimizing `pos[m]` (the position of the last beacon).

5. **Modeling Choices**: 
   - Since beacons are ordered, we can enforce `pos[i] < pos[i+1]` for i > 1 to break symmetry
   - For the unique distance constraint, we need to consider all pairs (i,j) where i < j, and ensure all distances `pos[j] - pos[i]` are different
   - We can set a reasonable upper bound for positions based on the problem size

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Signal Beacon Positioning Problem
% Place m beacons along a path such that all pairwise distances are unique
% and the total path length is minimized

% Input parameter
int: m; % number of beacons

% Decision variables: positions of beacons
array[1..m] of var 0..m*m: pos;

% Constraints

% First beacon is always at position 0
constraint pos[1] = 0;

% Beacons are ordered along the path (strictly increasing after position 0)
constraint forall(i in 2..m) (
    pos[i-1] < pos[i]
);

% All pairwise distances must be unique
% For any two pairs of beacons, their distances must be different
constraint forall(i, j, k, l in 1..m where i < j /\ k < l /\ (i != k \/ j != l)) (
    pos[j] - pos[i] != pos[l] - pos[k]
);

% Objective: minimize the total design length (position of last beacon)
solve minimize pos[m];

% Output
output ["Beacon positions: "] ++ [show(pos[i]) ++ " " | i in 1..m] ++ ["\n"] ++
       ["Total length: " ++ show(pos[m]) ++ "\n"];
