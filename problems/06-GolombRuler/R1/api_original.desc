**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to model a Golomb ruler with \(m\) marks, defined as a strictly increasing sequence of integers starting from 0, where all pairwise differences between marks are distinct. The objective is to minimize the length, which is the largest mark \(a_m\).

2. **Decision Variables**: 
   - An array `a` of size \(m\) represents the marks, with `a[1]` fixed to 0.
   - Each `a[i]` for \(i > 1\) is an integer variable with a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound based on \(m\) to ensure finite domains.

3. **Domains**: 
   - The domain for `a[i]` is set to \(0 \ldots m^2\) for simplicity and efficiency, as known optimal Golomb ruler lengths for small \(m\) are within this bound (e.g., for \(m=10\), optimal length is 55, and \(m^2=100\) is sufficient).

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Strictly Increasing**: `a[i] < a[i+1]` for all \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - **Distinct Differences**: All differences \(a[j] - a[i]\) for \(i < j\) must be distinct, enforced using `all_different` on a computed list of differences.
   - **Symmetry Breaking**: For \(m \geq 3\), add `a[2] < a[m] - a[m-1]` to break symmetry by ensuring the first gap is smaller than the last gap. This constraint is skipped for \(m < 3\) as it is unnecessary or invalid.

5. **Objective**: Minimize `a[m]`, the length of the ruler.

6. **Edge Cases**: The model handles \(m=1\) (no differences) and \(m=2\) (only one difference) correctly without symmetry breaking.

**MiniZinc Model:**
```minizinc
% Golomb Ruler Model
% Parameters: m - number of marks
% Variables: a - array of marks, with a[1] = 0
% Constraints: marks are strictly increasing, all pairwise differences are distinct, and symmetry breaking for m >= 3
% Objective: minimize the length a[m]

int: m; % Number of marks (must be at least 1)

set of int: MARK = 1..m;
array[MARK] of var 0..m*m: a; % Marks: a[1] = 0, others are integers up to m*m

constraint a[1] = 0; % First mark is always 0
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1)(a[i] < a[i+1]); % Marks are strictly increasing

% All pairwise differences must be distinct
constraint all_different([a[j] - a[i] | i in MARK, j in MARK where i < j]);

% Symmetry breaking: for m >= 3, ensure first gap is less than last gap
constraint if m >= 3 then a[2] < a[m] - a[m-1] else true endif;

solve minimize a[m]; % Minimize the length of the ruler

% Output: The ruler marks and length
output ["Golomb ruler with ", show(m), " marks: ", show(a), "\nLength: ", show(a[m])];
