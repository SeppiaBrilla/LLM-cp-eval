**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves placing m beacons along a straight path with the first beacon fixed at position 0. The key requirement is that all pairwise distances between beacons must be unique, meaning no two pairs of beacons share the same distance. This is analogous to the Golomb ruler problem in combinatorics. The objective is to minimize the position of the last beacon (the path length) to reduce costs, as shorter paths may allow for less expensive beacon types or fewer beacons, though specific details on beacon types and costs are not provided.

2. **Variables**: 
   - Let `p` be an array of size m, where `p[i]` represents the position of the i-th beacon.
   - `p[1]` is fixed to 0.
   - For i=2..m, `p[i]` are decision variables that must be strictly increasing to ensure beacons are placed in order along the path.

3. **Domains**: 
   - `p[i]` for i=1..m are non-negative integers. Since the positions are discrete and ordered, `p[i]` must satisfy `p[i] > p[i-1]` for i>1. An upper bound for `p[m]` is needed; here, we use a parameter `max_length` that can be set based on m (e.g., from known Golomb ruler bounds).

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Ordering**: `p[1] = 0` and `p[i] > p[i-1]` for i=2..m.
   - **Unique Differences**: All pairwise differences `p[j] - p[i]` for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m must be distinct. This is enforced by generating all such differences and applying the `all_different` constraint.

5. **Objective**: Minimize `p[m]`, the position of the last beacon, to achieve the shortest path length.

6. **Beacon Types Consideration**: The problem mentions beacon types with ranges and costs, but no specific rules or details are given to incorporate them into the model. Therefore, the model focuses on the core unique distance constraint and path length minimization. If additional information were provided, the model could be extended to include type assignments and cost objectives.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Model for Beacon Placement with Unique Pairwise Distances
% This models the Golomb ruler problem for m beacons, minimizing the last position.

% Parameters
int: m; % Number of beacons
int: max_length; % Upper bound for the position of the last beacon

% Decision Variables: positions of beacons
array[1..m] of var 0..max_length: p;

% Constraints
% First beacon at position 0
constraint p[1] = 0;

% Beacons are placed in strictly increasing order
constraint forall(i in 2..m) (p[i] > p[i-1]);

% All pairwise distances must be unique
% Generate all differences for i < j
constraint all_different([p[j] - p[i] | i in 1..m, j in i+1..m]);

% Objective: minimize the position of the last beacon
solve minimize p[m];

% Output (optional): show the positions and the differences
output ["Positions: ", show(p), "\n"] ++
       ["Differences: ", show([p[j] - p[i] | i in 1..m, j in i+1..m])];
```

**Note:** The `max_length` parameter should be set to a value large enough to accommodate the optimal solution for the given m. For small m, known values can be used (e.g., for m=4, max_length=6; for m=5, max_length=11). The output includes the positions and differences for verification. If beacon types were specified, additional variables and constraints could be added to model their costs and ranges.
