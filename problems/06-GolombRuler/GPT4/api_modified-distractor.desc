Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The positions of the beacons along the path. These are integer variables since the positions are discrete points along the path.
   - The type of each beacon. This is also an integer variable, representing the index of the beacon type in the given list of beacon types.

2. Domains:
   - The positions of the beacons can range from 0 to the maximum possible length of the path. Since we want to minimize the path length, we don't know this maximum length beforehand. Therefore, we can initially set it to a large enough value.
   - The type of each beacon can range from 1 to the number of beacon types.

3. Constraints:
   - The first beacon is always at position 0.
   - All pairs of beacons should have a unique distance. This can be ensured by making sure that the positions of the beacons are in increasing order. This way, the difference between the positions of any two beacons (i.e., the distance between them) will be unique.
   - The total cost of the beacons should not exceed the given budget. This can be ensured by summing up the costs of the chosen beacon types and constraining this sum to be less than or equal to the budget.

4. Objective Function:
   - The objective is to minimize the path length, which corresponds to the position of the last beacon.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - Instead of explicitly ensuring that all pairs of beacons have a unique distance, we can simply ensure that the positions of the beacons are in increasing order. This will automatically ensure the uniqueness of the distances.
   - We can use the 'cumulative' global constraint to ensure that the total cost of the beacons does not exceed the budget. This constraint is more efficient than summing up the costs manually.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the parameters
int: m; % The number of beacons
set of int: BEACONS = 1..m;
array[BEACONS] of var 0..1000: positions; % The positions of the beacons
array[BEACONS] of var 1..5: types; % The types of the beacons
array[1..5] of int: costs = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; % The costs of the beacon types
int: budget; % The budget for the beacons

% The first beacon is always at position 0
constraint positions[1] = 0;

% All pairs of beacons should have a unique distance
constraint increasing(positions);

% The total cost of the beacons should not exceed the budget
constraint sum(i in BEACONS)(costs[types[i]]) <= budget;

% Minimize the path length
solve minimize positions[m];

% Output the solution
output ["Beacon positions: " ++ show(positions) ++ "\n" ++
        "Beacon types: " ++ show(types)];
```

In this model, 'm' is the number of beacons, 'positions' is an array of decision variables representing the positions of the beacons, 'types' is an array of decision variables representing the types of the beacons, 'costs' is an array of the costs of the beacon types, and 'budget' is the budget for the beacons. The 'increasing' constraint ensures that the positions of the beacons are in increasing order, and the 'sum' constraint ensures that the total cost of the beacons does not exceed the budget. The objective is to minimize the position of the last beacon, which corresponds to the path length. The solution is outputted as the positions and types of the beacons.
