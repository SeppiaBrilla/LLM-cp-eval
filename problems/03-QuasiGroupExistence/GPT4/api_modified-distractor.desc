Reasoning:

1. The problem is about finding a delivery schedule for a fleet of drones. The schedule must satisfy certain conditions, which can be translated into constraints in a mathematical model.

2. The decision variables are the time slots assigned to each drone for each delivery zone. These are integer variables, and their domain is from 1 to m, where m is the number of drones and delivery zones.

3. The constraints are as follows:
   - Each drone uses every time slot exactly once. This means that for each drone, the time slots assigned to it for all delivery zones must be different.
   - Each delivery zone receives one delivery in every time slot. This means that for each delivery zone, the time slots assigned to all drones for it must be different.
   - If a * b = c, a * b = c * d and a *321 b = c *321 d, then a = c and b = d. This is a complex constraint that needs to be encoded carefully. It can be interpreted as follows: if two drones have the same time slot for two delivery zones, and the derived coordination patterns also match, then the drones and the delivery zones must be the same.

4. This is a satisfaction problem, as we are not trying to optimize any objective function. We are simply trying to find a schedule that satisfies all the constraints.

5. There are no obvious simplifications or modeling choices to prefer. The problem is already quite complex and requires careful encoding of the constraints.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
include "globals.mzn";

% Number of drones and delivery zones
int: m;

% Time slots assigned to each drone for each delivery zone
array[1..m, 1..m] of var 1..m: schedule;

% Each drone uses every time slot exactly once
constraint forall(i in 1..m) (
  alldifferent([schedule[i, j] | j in 1..m])
);

% Each delivery zone receives one delivery in every time slot
constraint forall(j in 1..m) (
  alldifferent([schedule[i, j] | i in 1..m])
);

% If a * b = c, a * b = c * d and a *321 b = c *321 d, then a = c and b = d
constraint forall(i, j, k, l in 1..m where i != k \/ j != l) (
  (schedule[i, j] = schedule[k, l] /\ 
  schedule[i, j] = schedule[schedule[i, j], l] /\ 
  schedule[i, schedule[i, j]] = schedule[schedule[i, j], schedule[schedule[i, j], l]])
  -> (i = k /\ j = l)
);
