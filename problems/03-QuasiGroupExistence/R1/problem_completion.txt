An order m quasigroup is a Latin square of size m. That is, a m x m multiplication table in which each element occurs once in every row and column. For example,
1    2   3   4
4    1   2   3
3    4   1   2
2    3   4   1
is an order 4 quasigroup. A quasigroup can be specified by a set and a binary multiplication operator, * defined over this set. Quasigroup existence problems determine whether there exists a quasigroup of a given order satisfying certain algebraic properties or constraints.
