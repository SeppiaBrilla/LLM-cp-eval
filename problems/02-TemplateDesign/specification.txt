original:
This problem arises from a colour printing firm which produces a variety of products from thin board, including cartons for human and animal food and magazine inserts. Food products, for example, are often marketed as a basic brand with several variations (typically flavours). Packaging for such variations usually has the same overall design, in particular the same size and shape, but differs in a small proportion of the text displayed and/or in colour. For instance, two variations of a cat food carton may differ only in that on one is printed ‘Chicken Flavour’ on a blue background whereas the other has ‘Rabbit Flavour’ printed on a green background. A typical order is for a variety of quantities of several design variations. Because each variation is identical in dimension, we know in advance exactly how many items can be printed on each mother sheet of board, whose dimensions are largely determined by the dimensions of the printing machinery. Each mother sheet is printed from a template, consisting of a thin aluminium sheet on which the design for several of the variations is etched. The problem is to decide, firstly, how many distinct templates to produce, and secondly, which variations, and how many copies of each, to include on each template.
modified-context-only:
A paper manufacturing company produces sets of patterned panels used in promotional displays. Usually, these displays belong to a single set where each item shares the same form and dimensions but has different details, such as colour accents, labels, or fonts. For example, one set might include panels where only the background differs or a piece of text distinguishes one from another. When fulfilling an order, the facility typically needs a mix of several variations in specific quantities. Because the dimensions are identical across the sets, it is possible to determine in advance exactly how many panels of any type can be cut from a larger master sheet. The master sheet dimensions are constrained by the equipment that processes them. Each master sheet is created using a rigid frame, into which the layouts for several variations can be embedded at once. The problem is to decide, first, how many unique frames are necessary, and second, which variations (and how many of each variation) should be arranged on each frame.
