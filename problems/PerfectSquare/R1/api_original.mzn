### Reasoning

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves packing a set of squares of distinct integer sizes into a larger square without overlapping, with all squares aligned to the big square's borders. The sum of the areas of the small squares equals the area of the big square, making it a perfect packing. Additionally, the packing must be "simple," meaning no subset of two or more squares forms a rectangle within the big square.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Input**: The number of squares `n` and their sizes `s[1..n]` are given as parameters.
   - **Big Square Side Length `S`**: Computed from the total area of small squares, so `S^2 = sum(s[i]^2)`. Since `s[i]` are integers and the packing is perfect, `S` must be an integer.
   - **Positions**: For each square `i`, define its bottom-left corner coordinates `(x[i], y[i])` with domains ensuring the square fits within `[0, S] x [0, S]`.
   - **Constraints**:
     - **No Overlap**: For any two distinct squares, they must not overlap. This is enforced using disjunctive constraints (one square must be to the left, right, below, or above the other).
     - **Within Big Square**: Each square must be entirely inside the big square, handled by variable domains.
     - **Simple Condition**: No internal point `(x_val, y_val)` where `0 < x_val < S` and `0 < y_val < S` is a corner for four different squares. This ensures no subset of squares forms a rectangle.

3. **Modeling Choices**:
   - `S` is defined as a variable with a domain from `max(s)` to `sum(s)` and constrained to `S^2 = total_area`.
   - Positions `x[i]` and `y[i]` have domains `0..S - s[i]` to automatically satisfy within-bounds constraints.
   - The simple condition is enforced by iterating over all internal points and ensuring that for each, the count of squares having it as a corner is less than 4.
   - This is a satisfaction problem, so we use `solve satisfy`.

4. **Considerations**:
   - The model assumes `total_area` is a perfect square, so `S` is integer.
   - The simple condition constraint may be computationally expensive for large `S`, but it is necessary for correctness.
   - Symmetry breaking is not included for simplicity, but could be added for performance.

% Perfect Square Placement Problem (Squared Square)
% Pack squares of given sizes into a larger square without overlapping,
% with all squares aligned, and ensure no subset of squares forms a rectangle.

% Parameters
int: n; % Number of squares
array[1..n] of int: s; % Sizes of the squares (distinct integers)

% Derived parameters
int: total_area = sum(i in 1..n) (s[i] * s[i]); % Total area of small squares
int: max_s = max(s); % Maximum square size
int: sum_s = sum(s); % Sum of all sizes (for upper bound of S)

% Decision variables
var max_s..sum_s: S; % Side length of the big square
constraint S * S = total_area; % Ensure perfect packing

% Positions of bottom-left corners of squares
array[1..n] of var 0..S: x; % x-coordinates
array[1..n] of var 0..S: y; % y-coordinates

% Constraints to ensure squares fit within the big square
constraint forall(i in 1..n) (x[i] <= S - s[i]);
constraint forall(i in 1..n) (y[i] <= S - s[i]);

% No-overlap constraints
constraint forall(i, j in 1..n where i < j) (
    x[i] + s[i] <= x[j] \/ 
    x[j] + s[j] <= x[i] \/ 
    y[i] + s[i] <= y[j] \/ 
    y[j] + s[j] <= y[i]
);

% Simple condition: no internal point is a corner for four squares
constraint forall(x_val in 1..S-1, y_val in 1..S-1) (
    count(i in 1..n) (

        (x_val = x[i] + s[i] /\ y_val = y[i]) \/
        (x_val = x[i] /\ y_val = y[i] + s[i]) \/
        (x_val = x[i] + s[i] /\ y_val = y[i] + s[i])
