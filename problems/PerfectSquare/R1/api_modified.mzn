**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis:** The problem involves tiling a square park of side length \( S \) with smaller squares of distinct integer side lengths. The squares must be aligned with the park's boundaries, not overlap, and cover as much area as possible to minimize unused space. The anti-rectangle constraint (no group of zones larger than one forming a rectangular block) is automatically satisfied if all squares have distinct sizes, as the union of any two or more distinct squares cannot form a rectangle due to size differences.

2. **Key Elements:**
   - \( S \) is the side length of the park, assumed to be a given parameter for the model.
   - The squares have sizes from 1 to \( S \), but only a subset is used, with distinct sizes.
   - For each possible size \( a \) from 1 to \( S \), a boolean variable `used[a]` indicates whether a square of size \( a \) is placed.
   - If `used[a]` is true, variables `x[a]` and `y[a]` represent the bottom-left corner of the square, with domains ensuring it fits within the park: \( x[a] \in [1, S-a+1] \), \( y[a] \in [1, S-a+1] \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - **No Overlap:** For any two distinct sizes \( a \) and \( b \) where both squares are used, their squares must not overlap. This is enforced by ensuring that for each pair, one square is entirely to the left, right, above, or below the other.
   - **Distinct Sizes:** Since `used[a]` is defined for each size and only one square per size is considered, sizes are inherently distinct.

4. **Objective:** Maximize the total area covered by the squares, which is the sum of \( a^2 \) for all \( a \) where `used[a]` is true. This minimizes the unused area (\( S^2 - \text{total covered area} \)).

5. **Modeling Choices:**
   - \( S \) is a parameter to make the model concrete for a given park size.
   - The model does not require full coverage, allowing unused areas, but aims to minimize them via the objective.
   - The anti-rectangle constraint is not explicitly encoded as it is satisfied by distinct sizes.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Parameters
int: S; % Side length of the square park

% Decision variables
array[1..S] of var bool: used; % used[a] is true if a square of size a is placed
array[1..S] of var 1..S: x; % x[a] is the x-coordinate of the bottom-left corner for square of size a
array[1..S] of var 1..S: y; % y[a] is the y-coordinate of the bottom-left corner for square of size a

% Constraints: Ensure that for each size a, if used, the square fits within the park
constraint forall(a in 1..S) (
    used[a] -> (x[a] <= S - a + 1 /\ y[a] <= S - a + 1)
);

% Constraints: No overlap between any two squares that are used
constraint forall(a in 1..S, b in 1..S where a < b) (
    (used[a] /\ used[b]) -> (
        (x[a] + a <= x[b]) \/ (x[b] + b <= x[a]) \/ 
        (y[a] + a <= y[b]) \/ (y[b] + b <= y[a])
    )
);

% Objective: Maximize the total area covered by the squares
solve maximize sum(a in 1..S) (a * a * bool2int(used[a]));

% Output: Display the placement of squares
output [
    "S = ", show(S), "\n",
    "Used squares: ", show(used), "\n",
    "x positions: ", show(x), "\n",
    "y positions: ", show(y), "\n",
    "Total covered area: ", show(sum(a in 1..S) (a * a * bool2int(used[a]))), "\n"
];
```

This model takes \( S \) as a parameter and finds a packing of distinct squares that maximizes the covered area. The output includes which sizes are used and their positions. For a given \( S \), if no perfect tiling exists, it will find the best possible packing. The anti-rectangle constraint is inherently satisfied due to distinct sizes.
