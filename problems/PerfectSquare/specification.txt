original:
The perfect square placement problem (also called the squared square problem) is to pack a set of squares with given integer sizes into a bigger square in such a way that no squares overlap each other and all square borders are parallel to the border of the big square. For a perfect placement problem, all squares have different sizes. The sum of the square surfaces is equal to the surface of the packing square, so that there is no spare capacity. A simple perfect square placement problem is a perfect square placement problem in which no subset of the squares (greater than one) are placed in a rectangle.

A city planning department is designing a new square park. The park must be divided into a set of smaller zones of the same shape, each with an integer side length, to host different facilities such as playgrounds, gardens, courts, or plazas.
For design purposes, all facility zones must be aligned with the parkâ€™s boundaries, and, of course, the zones must no overlap with eachother, and every zone must be a distinct size. We would like to minimize the unused areas by covering the whole park.
Furthermore no group of zones larger than one may be arranged together to form a rectangular block, ensuring that the park layout maintains a varied and non-repetitive structure.
