**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine which square zones to place in the park and their positions. Each zone is characterized by its size (side length) and position (top-left corner coordinates).

2. **Domain Analysis**: 
   - Let the park have side length N (to be determined or given as parameter)
   - Zone sizes: positive integers from 1 to N
   - Zone positions: coordinates (x,y) where zones can be placed within the park boundaries

3. **Key Constraints**:
   - **No overlap**: Zones cannot overlap with each other
   - **Within boundaries**: All zones must fit completely within the park
   - **Distinct sizes**: Each zone must have a different side length
   - **Complete coverage**: The entire park area must be covered (minimize unused area)
   - **No rectangular arrangements**: No group of zones can form a rectangular block together

4. **Modeling Approach**:
   - Use a grid-based approach where each cell of the park is assigned to exactly one zone
   - Each zone is identified by its unique size
   - Track which zone occupies each cell of the park
   - The "no rectangular block" constraint is the most complex - we need to ensure that no subset of zones can be arranged to form a rectangle

5. **Objective**: This is primarily a satisfaction problem (complete coverage), but we could minimize unused area if partial coverage is allowed.

6. **Simplification**: For the rectangular block constraint, we can check that for any rectangular region, it's not completely filled by a connected group of zones.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Square Park Zone Planning
% Parameters
int: N; % Side length of the square park
set of int: SIZES = 1..N; % Possible zone sizes
set of int: COORDS = 1..N; % Coordinate range

% Decision variables
% For each possible zone size, decide if it's used and where it's placed
array[SIZES] of var bool: used; % Whether each size is used
array[SIZES] of var COORDS: zone_x; % X coordinate of top-left corner
array[SIZES] of var COORDS: zone_y; % Y coordinate of top-left corner

% Grid assignment: each cell is assigned to a zone (identified by its size)
array[COORDS, COORDS] of var 0..N: grid; % 0 means unused, otherwise zone size

% Constraint: If a zone size is used, it must be placed within boundaries
constraint forall(s in SIZES) (
  used[s] -> (zone_x[s] + s - 1 <= N /\ zone_y[s] + s - 1 <= N)
);

% Constraint: If a zone is used, fill the corresponding grid cells
constraint forall(s in SIZES) (
  used[s] -> forall(i in 0..s-1, j in 0..s-1) (
    grid[zone_x[s] + i, zone_y[s] + j] = s
  )
);

% Constraint: If a zone is not used, it shouldn't appear in the grid
constraint forall(s in SIZES) (
  not used[s] -> forall(i in COORDS, j in COORDS) (
    grid[i, j] != s
  )
);

% Constraint: Each cell belongs to at most one zone
constraint forall(i in COORDS, j in COORDS) (
  sum(s in SIZES where used[s] /\ 
      zone_x[s] <= i /\ i <= zone_x[s] + s - 1 /\
      zone_y[s] <= j /\ j <= zone_y[s] + s - 1) (1) <= 1
);

% Constraint: Complete coverage (every cell must be assigned to some zone)
constraint forall(i in COORDS, j in COORDS) (
  grid[i, j] > 0
);

% Constraint: All used zones have distinct sizes (automatically satisfied by design)
% This is implicit since each size can only be used once

% Constraint: No rectangular blocks formed by multiple zones
% Check that no rectangular region is completely filled by a connected group of zones
constraint forall(x1, y1, x2, y2 in COORDS where x1 <= x2 /\ y1 <= y2 /\ 
                  (x2 - x1 + 1) * (y2 - y1 + 1) > 1) (
  % If this rectangle spans multiple zones, ensure it's not a valid rectangular block
  let {
    set of int: zones_in_rect = {grid[i, j] | i in x1..x2, j in y1..y2}
  } in (
    % If rectangle contains multiple different zones, check it's not forming a block
    card(zones_in_rect) > 1 -> 
      exists(i in x1..x2, j in y1..y2) (
        % There must be some "irregularity" - adjacent cells with different zones
        % that break the rectangular pattern
        (i < x2 /\ grid[i, j] != grid[i+1, j]) \/
        (j < y2 /\ grid[i, j] != grid[i, j+1])
      )
  )
);

% Alternative formulation for the rectangular block constraint:
% Ensure that any rectangular region that could be formed by multiple zones
% has at least one "notch" or irregularity
constraint forall(x1, y1, x2, y2 in COORDS where 
                  x1 < x2 /\ y1 < y2) (
  % Count distinct zones in this rectangle
  let {
    array[int] of int: zones_list = [grid[i, j] | i in x1..x2, j in y1..y2];
    set of int: unique_zones = array2set(zones_list);
  } in (
    card(unique_zones) > 1 -> 
      % If multiple zones, ensure the boundary between zones creates irregularity
      exists(i in x1..x2-1, j in y1..y2-1) (
        grid[i, j] != grid[i+1, j] \/ grid[i, j] != grid[i, j+1]
      )
  )
);
