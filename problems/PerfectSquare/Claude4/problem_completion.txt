The perfect square placement problem (also called the squared square problem) is to pack a set of squares with given integer sizes into a bigger square in such a way that no squares overlap each other and all square borders are parallel to the border of the big square. For a perfect placement problem, a solution exists if and only if the sum of the areas of all smaller squares equals the area of the big square, and there exists a valid non-overlapping arrangement where each smaller square can be placed with its edges aligned to a grid structure within the larger square.
