**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine the position of each square within the big square. For each square i, we need:
   - `x[i]`: x-coordinate of the bottom-left corner
   - `y[i]`: y-coordinate of the bottom-left corner

2. **Input Parameters**: 
   - `n`: number of squares to place
   - `sizes[i]`: size (side length) of square i
   - `big_size`: size of the big square (can be computed as sqrt of sum of areas)

3. **Domains**:
   - `x[i]` and `y[i]` must be in range `0..big_size-sizes[i]` to ensure squares fit within bounds

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Non-overlap**: For any two squares i and j, they must not overlap. This means either:
     - Square i is completely to the left of j: `x[i] + sizes[i] <= x[j]`, OR
     - Square i is completely to the right of j: `x[j] + sizes[j] <= x[i]`, OR  
     - Square i is completely below j: `y[i] + sizes[i] <= y[j]`, OR
     - Square i is completely above j: `y[j] + sizes[j] <= y[i]`
   - **Boundary constraints**: Each square must fit within the big square
   - **Perfect packing**: The sum of areas equals the big square's area (this determines big_size)

5. **Objective**: This is a satisfaction problem - we just need to find a valid placement.

6. **Modeling choices**: 
   - Use disjunctive constraints for non-overlap (either separated horizontally OR vertically)
   - Pre-compute the big square size from the sum of areas
   - The "simple" requirement (no subset forms a rectangle) is complex to encode directly, so we'll focus on the basic perfect square placement

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Perfect Square Placement Problem
% Pack squares of different sizes into a big square with no overlaps

% Input parameters
int: n; % number of squares
array[1..n] of int: sizes; % sizes of the squares

% Compute the size of the big square
int: total_area = sum(i in 1..n)(sizes[i] * sizes[i]);
int: big_size = round(sqrt(total_area));

% Decision variables: position of bottom-left corner of each square
array[1..n] of var 0..big_size: x;
array[1..n] of var 0..big_size: y;

% Constraint: squares must fit within the big square
constraint forall(i in 1..n) (
  x[i] + sizes[i] <= big_size /\
  y[i] + sizes[i] <= big_size
);

% Constraint: no two squares overlap
constraint forall(i, j in 1..n where i < j) (
  % Either separated horizontally or vertically
  x[i] + sizes[i] <= x[j] \/  % i is left of j
  x[j] + sizes[j] <= x[i] \/  % j is left of i  
  y[i] + sizes[i] <= y[j] \/  % i is below j
  y[j] + sizes[j] <= y[i]     % j is below i
);

% Verify perfect packing (total area constraint)
constraint big_size * big_size = total_area;

% Symmetry breaking: place largest square at origin
constraint 
  let { int: max_idx = arg_max(sizes) } in
  x[max_idx] = 0 /\ y[max_idx] = 0;

solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
output [
  "Big square size: " ++ show(big_size) ++ "\n" ++
  "Square placements (x, y, size):\n"
] ++
[
  "Square " ++ show(i) ++ ": (" ++ show(x[i]) ++ ", " ++ show(y[i]) ++ 
  ", " ++ show(sizes[i]) ++ ")\n"
  | i in 1..n
];

% Example data for testing (uncomment to use):
% n = 4;
% sizes = [2, 3, 4, 5]; % This gives total_area = 54, big_size should be calculated
