**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine the position of each square within the big square. For each square i, we need:
   - `x[i]`: x-coordinate of the bottom-left corner
   - `y[i]`: y-coordinate of the bottom-left corner

2. **Input Parameters**: 
   - `n`: number of squares to place
   - `sizes[i]`: the side length of square i
   - `big_size`: the side length of the big square (can be computed as sqrt of sum of areas)

3. **Domains**:
   - `x[i]` and `y[i]` must be non-negative and ensure the square fits within the big square
   - So `x[i] ∈ [0, big_size - sizes[i]]` and `y[i] ∈ [0, big_size - sizes[i]]`

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Non-overlap constraint**: For any two squares i and j, they must not overlap. Two squares don't overlap if one is completely to the left, right, above, or below the other
   - **Boundary constraints**: Each square must fit completely within the big square
   - **Perfect packing constraint**: The sum of areas of all small squares equals the area of the big square
   - **Different sizes constraint**: All squares have different sizes (given in problem statement)

5. **Objective**: This is a constraint satisfaction problem (finding a valid placement), not an optimization problem.

6. **Modeling choices**: 
   - We can compute `big_size` as the integer square root of the sum of all square areas
   - For non-overlap, we use disjunctive constraints: squares i and j don't overlap if (x[i] + sizes[i] ≤ x[j]) OR (x[j] + sizes[j] ≤ x[i]) OR (y[i] + sizes[i] ≤ y[j]) OR (y[j] + sizes[j] ≤ y[i])

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Perfect Square Placement Problem
% Pack squares with different integer sizes into a bigger square
% with no overlaps and no wasted space

% Number of squares to place
int: n;

% Sizes of the squares (all different)
array[1..n] of int: sizes;

% Calculate the size of the big square
% The sum of areas must equal the big square's area
int: total_area = sum(i in 1..n)(sizes[i] * sizes[i]);
int: big_size = round(sqrt(total_area));

% Verify that we have a perfect square
constraint big_size * big_size = total_area;

% Decision variables: position of bottom-left corner of each square
array[1..n] of var 0..big_size: x;
array[1..n] of var 0..big_size: y;

% Constraint: each square must fit within the big square
constraint forall(i in 1..n)(
    x[i] + sizes[i] <= big_size /\
    y[i] + sizes[i] <= big_size
);

% Constraint: no two squares overlap
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in i+1..n)(
    x[i] + sizes[i] <= x[j] \/  % square i is to the left of square j
    x[j] + sizes[j] <= x[i] \/  % square j is to the left of square i  
    y[i] + sizes[i] <= y[j] \/  % square i is below square j
    y[j] + sizes[j] <= y[i]     % square j is below square i
);

% Constraint: all sizes are different (assumed from problem statement)
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in i+1..n)(sizes[i] != sizes[j]);

% Output the solution
output [
    "Big square size: " ++ show(big_size) ++ "\n" ++
    "Square positions:\n"
] ++
[
    "Square " ++ show(i) ++ " (size " ++ show(sizes[i]) ++ 
    "): (" ++ show(x[i]) ++ ", " ++ show(y[i]) ++ ")\n"
    | i in 1..n
];

% Example data (uncomment to test with a simple case)
% n = 4;
% sizes = [1, 2, 3, 4];  % Areas: 1, 4, 9, 16 -> Total: 30 (not a perfect square)
% Better example:
% n = 3; 
% sizes = [3, 4, 5];     % Areas: 9, 16, 25 -> Total: 50 (not a perfect square)
% Even better:
% n = 2;
% sizes = [3, 4];        % Areas: 9, 16 -> Total: 25 -> big_size = 5
