Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The side length of each zone (integer).
   - The position of each zone within the park (integer coordinates).
   - The unused area of the park (integer).

2. Domains:
   - The side length of each zone must be a positive integer.
   - The position of each zone must be within the park boundaries, which are defined by the park's side length.
   - The unused area of the park must be a non-negative integer.

3. Constraints:
   - All zones must be aligned with the park's boundaries. This means that the position of each zone must be a multiple of its side length.
   - Zones must not overlap. This can be ensured by making sure that for any two zones, either their x-coordinates or their y-coordinates are not within the side length of the other.
   - Every zone must be a distinct size. This can be ensured by making sure that no two zones have the same side length.
   - No group of zones larger than one may be arranged together to form a rectangular block. This can be ensured by making sure that for any two zones, they are not adjacent to each other on both the x and y axes.
   - The unused area of the park must be minimized. This can be ensured by making the sum of the areas of all zones as close as possible to the area of the park.

4. Objective Function:
   - This is an optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the unused area of the park.

5. Potential Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - We can assume that the park is a square with a side length of 1 unit for simplicity. This means that the side length of each zone and the position of each zone are fractions of 1.
   - We can model the park as a 2D array where each cell represents a unit area of the park. The value of each cell can be the index of the zone that occupies it, or -1 if it is unused.
   - We can model the zones as a list of tuples where each tuple contains the side length and position of a zone.
   - We can model the unused area of the park as a variable that is equal to the number of cells in the 2D array that have a value of -1.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the size of the park
int: park_size = 10;

% Define the maximum number of zones
int: max_zones = 10;

% Define the decision variables
array[1..max_zones] of var 1..park_size: zone_side_length;
array[1..max_zones, 1..2] of var 1..park_size: zone_position;
var 0..park_size*park_size: unused_area;

% Define the constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..max_zones, j in i+1..max_zones) (
  % Zones must not overlap
  (zone_position[i,1] + zone_side_length[i] <= zone_position[j,1]) \/
  (zone_position[j,1] + zone_side_length[j] <= zone_position[i,1]) \/
  (zone_position[i,2] + zone_side_length[i] <= zone_position[j,2]) \/
  (zone_position[j,2] + zone_side_length[j] <= zone_position[i,2])
);

constraint forall(i in 1..max_zones, j in i+1..max_zones) (
  % Every zone must be a distinct size
  zone_side_length[i] != zone_side_length[j]
);

constraint forall(i in 1..max_zones, j in i+1..max_zones) (
  % No group of zones larger than one may be arranged together to form a rectangular block
  (abs(zone_position[i,1] - zone_position[j,1]) > 1) \/
  (abs(zone_position[i,2] - zone_position[j,2]) > 1)
);

constraint unused_area = park_size*park_size - sum(i in 1..max_zones)(zone_side_length[i]*zone_side_length[i]);

% Define the objective function
solve minimize unused_area;

% Output the solution
output ["Unused area: ", show(unused_area), "\n"];
output ["Zones:\n"];
output [show(zone_side_length[i]), " ", show(zone_position[i,1]), " ", show(zone_position[i,2]), "\n" | i in 1..max_zones];
```

Note: This model assumes that the park is a square with a side length of 10 units and that there can be at most 10 zones. The actual values will depend on the specific problem instance.
