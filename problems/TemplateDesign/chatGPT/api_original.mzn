Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The number of distinct templates to produce.
   - The number of copies of each variation to include on each template.

2. Domains:
   - The number of distinct templates is a positive integer.
   - The number of copies of each variation on each template is a positive integer.

3. Constraints:
   - The total number of copies of each variation must meet the demand for that variation.
   - The total number of variations on a template must not exceed the maximum number of items that can be printed on a mother sheet.

4. This is an optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the number of distinct templates produced.

5. Simplifications/Modeling Choices:
   - We can assume that the demand for each variation is known and fixed.
   - We can assume that the maximum number of items that can be printed on a mother sheet is known and fixed.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Number of variations
int: n_variations;

% Demand for each variation
array[1..n_variations] of int: demand;

% Maximum number of items that can be printed on a mother sheet
int: max_items;

% Number of distinct templates
var 1..n_variations: n_templates;

% Number of copies of each variation on each template
array[1..n_variations, 1..n_templates] of var 0..max_items: copies;

% The total number of copies of each variation must meet the demand for that variation
constraint forall(i in 1..n_variations) (
  sum(j in 1..n_templates) (copies[i, j]) = demand[i]
);

% The total number of variations on a template must not exceed the maximum number of items that can be printed on a mother sheet
constraint forall(j in 1..n_templates) (
  sum(i in 1..n_variations) (copies[i, j]) <= max_items
);

% Minimize the number of distinct templates
solve minimize n_templates;

output ["Number of distinct templates: ", show(n_templates), "\n",
        "Number of copies of each variation on each template: ", show(copies)];
```

This model assumes that the demand for each variation and the maximum number of items that can be printed on a mother sheet are known and fixed. The decision variables are the number of distinct templates to produce and the number of copies of each variation to include on each template. The constraints ensure that the total number of copies of each variation meets the demand for that variation and that the total number of variations on a template does not exceed the maximum number of items that can be printed on a mother sheet. The objective is to minimize the number of distinct templates produced.
