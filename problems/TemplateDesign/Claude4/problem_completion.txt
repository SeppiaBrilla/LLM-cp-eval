This problem arises from a colour printing firm which produces a variety of products from thin board, including cartons for human and animal food and magazine inserts. Food products, for example, are often marketed as a basic brand with several variations (typically flavours). Packaging for such variations usually has the same overall design, in particular the same size and shape, but differs in a small proportion of the text displayed and/or in colour. For instance, two variations of a cat food carton may differ only in that on one is printed 'Chicken Flavour' on a blue background whereas the other has 'Rabbit Flavour' printed on a red background. The printing firm must determine how to optimally schedule the production of these similar but distinct packaging variants to minimize setup costs and changeover times between different colours and text configurations while meeting customer delivery deadlines and maintaining efficient use of printing press capacity.
