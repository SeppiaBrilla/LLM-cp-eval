Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The number of unique frames necessary.
   - The number of each variation to be arranged on each frame.

2. Domains:
   - The number of unique frames necessary: This is a positive integer.
   - The number of each variation to be arranged on each frame: This is a positive integer.

3. Constraints:
   - The total number of each variation on all frames must be equal to the required quantity of that variation.
   - The total number of variations on a frame must not exceed the maximum number of panels that can be cut from a master sheet.

4. This is an optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the number of unique frames necessary.

5. Potential Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - We can assume that the number of each variation to be arranged on each frame is a decision variable. However, it might be more efficient to treat it as a derived variable, calculated from the number of unique frames necessary and the required quantity of each variation.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the parameters
int: num_variations; % The number of variations
array[1..num_variations] of int: required_quantities; % The required quantity of each variation
int: max_panels; % The maximum number of panels that can be cut from a master sheet

% Define the decision variables
var 1..num_variations: num_frames; % The number of unique frames necessary
array[1..num_variations, 1..num_frames] of var 0..max_panels: num_each_variation; % The number of each variation to be arranged on each frame

% Define the constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..num_variations)(
  sum(j in 1..num_frames)(num_each_variation[i, j]) = required_quantities[i]
);
constraint forall(j in 1..num_frames)(
  sum(i in 1..num_variations)(num_each_variation[i, j]) <= max_panels
);

% Define the objective
solve minimize num_frames;

% Output the solution
output ["Number of unique frames necessary: ", show(num_frames), "\n"];
output ["Number of each variation to be arranged on each frame:\n"];
output [show(num_each_variation[i, j]) | i in 1..num_variations, j in 1..num_frames];
```

This model assumes that the number of each variation to be arranged on each frame is a decision variable. However, it might be more efficient to treat it as a derived variable, calculated from the number of unique frames necessary and the required quantity of each variation. This would reduce the number of decision variables and potentially make the model easier to solve.
