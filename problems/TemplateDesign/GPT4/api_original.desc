Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The number of distinct templates to produce.
   - The number of copies of each variation to include on each template.

2. Domains:
   - The number of distinct templates to produce: This is a positive integer.
   - The number of copies of each variation to include on each template: This is a positive integer.

3. Constraints:
   - The total number of copies of each variation must meet the demand for that variation.
   - The total number of variations on each template must not exceed the maximum number of variations that can fit on a template.

4. Objective Function:
   - Minimize the number of distinct templates produced.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - We can assume that the number of copies of each variation on a template is the same for all variations on that template. This simplifies the problem by reducing the number of decision variables.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the number of variations and the maximum number of variations per template
int: num_variations;
int: max_variations_per_template;

% Define the demand for each variation
array[1..num_variations] of int: demand;

% Decision variables
% The number of distinct templates to produce
var 1..num_variations: num_templates;

% The number of copies of each variation to include on each template
array[1..num_variations] of var 0..max_variations_per_template: copies_per_template;

% Constraints
% The total number of copies of each variation must meet the demand for that variation
constraint forall(i in 1..num_variations) (
  sum(j in 1..num_templates) (copies_per_template[j]) >= demand[i]
);

% The total number of variations on each template must not exceed the maximum number of variations that can fit on a template
constraint forall(j in 1..num_templates) (
  sum(i in 1..num_variations) (bool2int(copies_per_template[i] > 0)) <= max_variations_per_template
);

% Objective function
% Minimize the number of distinct templates produced
solve minimize num_templates;

% Output the solution
output ["Number of templates: ", show(num_templates), "\n"] ++
["Copies per template: ", show(copies_per_template), "\n"];
```

Note: This model assumes that the number of copies of each variation on a template is the same for all variations on that template. This simplifies the problem by reducing the number of decision variables. However, it may not always produce the optimal solution. For example, if the demand for one variation is much higher than for others, it may be more efficient to produce more copies of that variation on each template.
