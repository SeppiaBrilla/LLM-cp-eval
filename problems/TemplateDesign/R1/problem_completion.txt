This problem arises from a colour printing firm which produces a variety of products from thin board, including cartons for human and animal food and magazine inserts. Food products, for example, are often marketed as a basic brand with several variations (typically flavours). Packaging for such variations usually has the same overall design, in particular the same size and shape, but differs in a small proportion of the text displayed and/or in colour. For instance, two variations of a cat food carton may differ only in that on one is printed ‘Chicken Flavour’ on a blue background whereas the other has ‘Rabbit Flavour’ print. However, producing these variations requires changeovers in the printing process, such as adjusting colors or text, which incur setup times and costs. The firm needs to optimize its production scheduling to minimize the total changeover time and cost while meeting the demand for all variations, considering constraints like machine availability and order deadlines.
