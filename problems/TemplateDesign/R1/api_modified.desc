**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Understanding**: The company produces panels with variations that have identical dimensions but differ in details. Orders require specific quantities of each variation. Master sheets with frames are used, where each frame can hold multiple panels. The goal is to determine the number of unique frame designs and their compositions (how many of each variation per frame) to meet demand while minimizing the number of unique frames, likely to reduce setup costs.

2. **Key Parameters**:
   - `V`: Number of variations.
   - `d_v` for each variation `v`: Demand quantity.
   - `N`: Maximum number of panels per master sheet (frame), determined by equipment constraints.

3. **Decision Variables**:
   - `u_k` for each potential frame `k`: Usage count (number of times frame `k` is used).
   - `a_{k,v}` for each frame `k` and variation `v`: Number of panels of variation `v` on frame `k`.
   - The number of unique frames is the number of frames with `u_k > 0`.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Capacity**: For each frame, the total panels must not exceed `N`.
   - **Demand**: For each variation, the total production across all frames must meet or exceed demand.
   - **Domains**: `u_k` are non-negative integers, and `a_{k,v}` are integers between 0 and `N`.

5. **Objective**: Minimize the number of unique frames (i.e., frames with `u_k > 0`).

6. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Set an upper bound `K_max = V` on the number of potential frames, as the number of unique frames cannot exceed the number of variations in the worst case.
   - Use `bool2int` to count frames with positive usage for the objective.
   - No additional symmetry-breaking constraints are included for simplicity, as the minimization should naturally avoid duplicate frames.

**MiniZinc model:**
```minizinc
% Parameters
int: V; % Number of variations
array[1..V] of int: d; % Demand for each variation
int: N; % Maximum panels per frame

% Derived parameter: upper bound on unique frames
int: K_max = V; % Since unique frames <= V in worst case

% Decision variables
array[1..K_max] of var 0..sum(d): u; % Usage count for each frame
array[1..K_max, 1..V] of var 0..N: a; % Panels per variation per frame

% Constraint: Each frame's total panels <= N
constraint forall(k in 1..K_max) (
    sum(v in 1..V)(a[k, v]) <= N
);

% Constraint: Meet demand for each variation
constraint forall(v in 1..V) (
    sum(k in 1..K_max)(u[k] * a[k, v]) >= d[v]
);

% Objective: Minimize number of unique frames (frames with u[k] > 0)
var int: num_unique_frames = sum(k in 1..K_max)(bool2int(u[k] > 0));
solve minimize num_unique_frames;

% Output: Show unique frames and their compositions
output [
    "Number of unique frames: ", show(num_unique_frames), "\n",
    "Frame usage and compositions:\n"
] ++
[
    if k <= num_unique_frames then
        "Frame " ++ show(k) ++ ": used " ++ show(u[k]) ++ " times, composition " ++ 
        show([a[k, v] | v in 1..V]) ++ "\n"
    else "" endif
| k in 1..K_max
];
