The coordinator of a local golf club has come to you with the following problem. In their club, there are 32 social golfers, each of whom play golf once a week, and always in groups of 4. They want to schedule the golfers into groups over multiple weeks such that every pair of golfers plays together in the same group exactly once, and no pair of golfers plays together more than once.
