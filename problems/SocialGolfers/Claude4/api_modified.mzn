**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to decide which scientists are in which teams in which weeks. Let's use a 3D binary array `x[w,t,s]` where `x[w,t,s] = 1` if scientist `s` is in team `t` during week `w`, and 0 otherwise.

2. **Domains**: 
   - Scientists: 1..32
   - Teams per week: 1..8 (since 32 scientists ÷ 4 scientists per team = 8 teams)
   - Weeks: 1..W (where W is the number of weeks we want to maximize)

3. **Constraints**:
   - Each team has exactly 4 scientists each week
   - Each scientist is in exactly one team each week
   - No two scientists can be in the same team more than once across all weeks

4. **Objective**: Maximize the number of weeks W

5. **Key insight**: This is a combinatorial design problem. The maximum number of weeks is bounded by the fact that each scientist can pair with at most 31 other scientists, and in each week they pair with 3 others. So theoretically, each scientist could participate in at most ⌊31/3⌋ = 10 weeks before running out of new teammates. However, the global constraint that no pair appears twice is more restrictive.

6. **Modeling choice**: Since we want to maximize weeks, we can either:
   - Fix W and solve for satisfaction, then increase W until unsatisfiable
   - Use an optimization model with W as the objective
   
   I'll use the optimization approach.

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Brainstorming session scheduler
% Maximize weeks while ensuring no two scientists are teammates more than once

% Parameters
int: n_scientists = 32;
int: team_size = 4;
int: n_teams = n_scientists div team_size;  % 8 teams per week
int: max_weeks = 15;  % Upper bound estimate

% Decision variables
var 1..max_weeks: weeks;  % Number of weeks to maximize
array[1..max_weeks, 1..n_teams, 1..n_scientists] of var 0..1: x;

% Each team has exactly team_size scientists each active week
constraint forall(w in 1..max_weeks, t in 1..n_teams) (
    if w <= weeks then
        sum(s in 1..n_scientists)(x[w,t,s]) = team_size
    else
        sum(s in 1..n_scientists)(x[w,t,s]) = 0
    endif
);

% Each scientist is in exactly one team each active week
constraint forall(w in 1..max_weeks, s in 1..n_scientists) (
    if w <= weeks then
        sum(t in 1..n_teams)(x[w,t,s]) = 1
    else
        sum(t in 1..n_teams)(x[w,t,s]) = 0
    endif
);

% No two scientists can be teammates more than once
constraint forall(s1, s2 in 1..n_scientists where s1 < s2) (
    sum(w in 1..max_weeks, t in 1..n_teams)(
        x[w,t,s1] * x[w,t,s2]
    ) <= 1
);

% Symmetry breaking: order teams by their smallest member
constraint forall(w in 1..max_weeks, t in 1..n_teams-1) (
    min([s | s in 1..n_scientists where x[w,t,s] = 1] ++ [n_scientists+1]) <=
    min([s | s in 1..n_scientists where x[w,t+1,s] = 1] ++ [n_scientists+1])
);

% Objective: maximize number of weeks
solve maximize weeks;

% Output formatting
output [
    "Number of weeks: \(weeks)\n"
