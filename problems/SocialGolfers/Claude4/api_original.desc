**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to assign golfers to groups for each week. Let's define a 3D array where `schedule[w,g,p]` represents the golfer assigned to position `p` in group `g` during week `w`.

2. **Problem Parameters**:
   - 32 golfers (numbered 1..32)
   - Groups of 4 golfers each
   - 8 groups per week (32 ÷ 4 = 8)
   - We want to maximize the number of weeks

3. **Key Constraints**:
   - Each golfer plays exactly once per week
   - Each group has exactly 4 golfers
   - No two golfers can play together more than once across all weeks

4. **Theoretical Maximum**: Each golfer can play with at most 3 other golfers per week. Over multiple weeks, each golfer can play with at most 3 × number_of_weeks different golfers. Since there are 31 other golfers total, we have 3 × weeks ≤ 31, so weeks ≤ 10.33, meaning at most 10 weeks theoretically.

5. **Modeling Choice**: Instead of a 3D array, we can use a 2D array `groups[w,g]` where each element is a set of 4 golfers, but MiniZinc handles individual variables better. We'll use `schedule[w,g,p]` where `w` is week (1..W), `g` is group (1..8), `p` is position in group (1..4).

6. **Objective**: Maximize the number of weeks W, or fix W and solve as satisfaction problem.

7. **Symmetry Breaking**: We can order golfers within groups and order groups to reduce symmetry.

**MiniZinc model:**

% Social Golfers Problem
% 32 golfers, groups of 4, maximize weeks such that no pair meets twice

        bool2int(schedule[w,g,p1] = g1 /\ schedule[w,g,p2] = g2)

    forall(g in 1..n_groups-1) (
        schedule[w,g,1] < schedule[w,g+1,1]
    )
);

% Symmetry breaking: golfer 1 is always in group 1

% Only use variables for weeks that are actually scheduled
