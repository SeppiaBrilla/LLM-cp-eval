Reasoning:

1. The problem is about organizing teams of scientists in a way that no two scientists work in the same team more than once. This is a combinatorial problem, and it can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem.

2. The decision variables are the teams for each week. Each team is a set of 4 scientists, and each week there are 8 teams (since there are 32 scientists in total). Therefore, the decision variables can be represented as a 2D array of size [weeks][8][4], where each element of the array represents a scientist.

3. The domain of the decision variables is the set of all scientists, which is a set of integers from 1 to 32.

4. The constraints of the problem are:
   - Each scientist must be in exactly one team each week.
   - No two scientists can be in the same team more than once.

5. There is no objective function in this problem, as it is a constraint satisfaction problem.

6. A potential simplification of the problem is to consider the teams as unordered sets of scientists. This means that the order of the scientists in a team does not matter, which reduces the number of possible solutions.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the number of scientists, the size of teams, and the maximum number of weeks
% (the maximum number of weeks is the number of ways to choose 4 scientists from 32, divided by the number of teams per week)
enum SCIENTISTS = 1..32;
int: TEAMS_SIZE = 4;
int: MAX_WEEKS = comb(32, 4) div 8;

% Define the decision variables: the teams for each week
% The teams are represented as a 3D array of size [weeks][8][4]
array[1..MAX_WEEKS, 1..8, 1..TEAMS_SIZE] of var SCIENTISTS: teams;

% Each scientist must be in exactly one team each week
constraint forall(w in 1..MAX_WEEKS)(
  forall(s in SCIENTISTS)(
    sum(t in 1..8, m in 1..TEAMS_SIZE)(teams[w, t, m] = s) = 1
  )
);

% No two scientists can be in the same team more than once
constraint forall(s1 in SCIENTISTS, s2 in SCIENTISTS where s1 < s2)(
  sum(w in 1..MAX_WEEKS, t in 1..8)(
    sum(m in 1..TEAMS_SIZE)(teams[w, t, m] = s1) +
    sum(m in 1..TEAMS_SIZE)(teams[w, t, m] = s2)
  ) <= 1
);

% The teams are unordered sets of scientists, so we can impose an order to reduce the number of solutions
constraint forall(w in 1..MAX_WEEKS, t in 1..8)(
  increasing([teams[w, t, m] | m in 1..TEAMS_SIZE])
);

% Find a solution
solve satisfy;
```

Note: The function `comb(n, k)` computes the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements, and is used to calculate the maximum number of weeks. The function `increasing(array)` checks if the elements of `array` are in increasing order.
