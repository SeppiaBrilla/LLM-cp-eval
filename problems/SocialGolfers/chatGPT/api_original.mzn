Reasoning:

1. The decision variables are the golfers and the groups they belong to each week. We can represent this as a 3-dimensional array, where the first dimension represents the week, the second dimension represents the group, and the third dimension represents the golfer within the group.

2. The domain of the variables is 1..32, representing the 32 golfers.

3. The constraints are:
   - Each golfer must be in exactly one group each week.
   - No golfer can play in the same group as any other golfer more than once.

4. This is a satisfaction problem, as we are not optimizing any objective.

5. A potential simplification is to limit the number of weeks to a reasonable number, such as 8, to make the problem more tractable. This is because the maximum number of weeks that the schedule can last is 8 (since each golfer can play with 3 other golfers each week, and there are 31 other golfers to play with).

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Number of golfers, groups, and weeks
int: nGolfers = 32;
int: nGroups = nGolfers div 4;
int: nWeeks = 8;

% Decision variable: schedule[week, group, golfer]
array[1..nWeeks, 1..nGroups, 1..4] of var 1..nGolfers: schedule;

% Each golfer must be in exactly one group each week
constraint forall(w in 1..nWeeks, g in 1..nGolfers)(
  count([schedule[w, g2, p] | g2 in 1..nGroups, p in 1..4], g, 1)
);

% No golfer can play in the same group as any other golfer more than once
constraint forall(g in 1..nGolfers, g2 in g+1..nGolfers)(
  sum([bool2int(schedule[w, p, g3] = g /\ schedule[w, p, g4] = g2) |
       w in 1..nWeeks, p in 1..nGroups, g3 in 1..4, g4 in g3+1..4]) <= 1
);

solve satisfy;
```

This model assumes that the golfers are numbered from 1 to 32, and that the groups are numbered from 1 to 8. The `schedule` variable represents the golfer who is in a particular group in a particular week. The first constraint ensures that each golfer is in exactly one group each week, and the second constraint ensures that no golfer plays in the same group as any other golfer more than once.
