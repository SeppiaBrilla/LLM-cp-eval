### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling 32 golfers into groups of 4 for multiple weeks, with the constraint that no two golfers play together in the same group more than once. The goal is to maximize the number of weeks such that this condition holds.
2. **Key Variables**:
   - `W`: The number of weeks to schedule (to be maximized).
   - `group[w,p]`: The group number (1 to 8) of golfer `p` in week `w`.
   - `used[w]`: A boolean indicating whether week `w` is included in the schedule.
3. **Domains**:
   - `W` ranges from 1 to 10, as the maximum theoretical weeks is 10 based on pair counting: there are C(32,2)=496 possible pairs, and each week uses 8 groups Ã— C(4,2)=48 pairs, so 10 weeks use 480 pairs, which is feasible.
   - `group[w,p]` ranges from 1 to 8 for all weeks and golfers.
   - `used[w]` is a boolean for each week.
4. **Constraints**:
   - For each used week `w`, the group assignment must partition the 32 golfers into 8 groups of 4. This is enforced by requiring that for each group `g`, exactly 4 golfers have `group[w,p] = g`.
   - For each pair of golfers `(i,j)`, the number of used weeks where they are in the same group (i.e., `group[w,i] = group[w,j]`) is at most 1.
   - The `used` array must be consistent with `W`: `used[w]` is true if and only if `w <= W`.
5. **Objective**: Maximize `W`, the number of weeks scheduled.
6. **Modeling Choices**:
   - A fixed maximum of 10 weeks (`maxW`) is used to bound the problem.
   - The model uses reified constraints to only enforce conditions for used weeks, improving efficiency.
   - The output displays the group assignments for each scheduled week.

### MiniZinc Model:
```minizinc
% Social Golfer Problem for 32 golfers, groups of 4
% Goal: Maximize the number of weeks such that no two golfers play together more than once.

int: N = 32; % Number of golfers
int: G = 8;  % Number of groups per week
int: P = 4;  % Golfers per group
int: maxW = 10; % Maximum number of weeks to consider

var 1..maxW: W; % Number of weeks scheduled
array[1..maxW] of var bool: used; % used[w] is true if week w is included
array[1..maxW, 1..N] of var 1..G: group; % group[w,p] is the group of golfer p in week w

% Constraint: used[w] is true iff week w is within the first W weeks
constraint forall(w in 1..maxW) (used[w] == (w <= W));

% Constraint: For each used week, each group has exactly P golfers
constraint forall(w in 1..maxW) (
    used[w] -> forall(g in 1..G) (
        count([group[w,p] | p in 1..N], g) = P
    )
);

% Constraint: For each pair of golfers, they are together in at most one used week
constraint forall(i in 1..N, j in 1..N where i < j) (
    sum(w in 1..maxW) (bool2int(used[w] /\ (group[w,i] == group[w,j]))) <= 1
);

% Objective: Maximize the number of weeks
solve maximize W;

% Output: Show the number of weeks and the group assignments for each scheduled week
output [
    "Number of weeks: ", show(W), "\n\n",
    "Group assignments per week (golfer -> group):\n"
] ++ [
    "Week " ++ show(w) ++ ": " ++ show([group[w,p] | p in 1..N]) ++ "\n"
    | w in 1..W
];
