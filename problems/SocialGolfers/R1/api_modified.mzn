**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - There are 32 scientists. Each week, they are divided into teams of 4, resulting in 8 teams per week.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of weeks such that no two scientists are in the same team more than once. This ensures diverse collaborations.

2. **Key Constraints**:
   - **Team Size**: Each week, if used, must have exactly 8 teams, each with exactly 4 scientists.
   - **Pair Occurrence**: For any pair of scientists, they can be in the same team in at most one week.

3. **Mathematical Insights**:
   - Total possible pairs of scientists: \( \binom{32}{2} = 496 \).
   - Pairs covered per week: 8 teams Ã— \( \binom{4}{2} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \) pairs.
   - Theoretical maximum weeks: \( \lfloor 496 / 48 \rfloor = 10 \). Thus, at most 10 weeks might be possible.

4. **Modeling Decisions**:
   - Set `max_weeks = 10` as an upper bound.
   - Define a binary array `used` for weeks, where `used[w]` is true if week `w` is scheduled.
   - Define a 2D array `assign` where `assign[w, s]` is the team (1..8) for scientist `s` in week `w`.
   - **Constraints**:
     - For each week `w`, if `used[w]` is true, then each team `t` in 1..8 must have exactly 4 scientists assigned to it.
     - For each pair of scientists `(s1, s2)` with `s1 < s2`, the number of weeks where both are in the same team and the week is used must be at most 1.
   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of used weeks, i.e., the sum of `used`.

5. **Implementation Notes**:
   - Use `count` constraints to enforce team sizes.
   - Use a nested loop and `bool2int` to compute pair occurrences.
   - The model allows unused weeks to have arbitrary assignments without affecting the pair constraints.

**MiniZinc model:**
```minizinc
% Maximizing weekly team assignments for 32 scientists with no repeated pairs
include "globals.mzn";

% Parameters
int: num_scientists = 32;
int: teams_per_week = 8;
int: team_size = 4;
int: max_weeks = 10; % Upper bound based on pair coverage

% Decision variables
array[1..max_weeks] of var bool: used; % true if week w is used
array[1..max_weeks, 1..num_scientists] of var 1..teams_per_week: assign;
% assign[w, s] is the team for scientist s in week w

% Derived variable: number of weeks used
var int: weeks_used = sum(used);

% Objective: maximize the number of weeks used
solve maximize weeks_used;

% Constraints

% For each week, if used, ensure each team has exactly team_size scientists
constraint forall (w in 1..max_weeks) (
    used[w] -> forall (t in 1..teams_per_week) (
        count([assign[w, s] | s in 1..num_scientists], t, team_size)
    )
);

% For each pair of scientists, they are in the same team at most once in used weeks
constraint forall (s1, s2 in 1..num_scientists where s1 < s2) (
    sum(w in 1..max_weeks) (
        bool2int(used[w] and (assign[w, s1] == assign[w, s2]))
    ) <= 1
);

% Symmetry breaking: for unused weeks, fix assignments to reduce search space
% Optional: can help solvers but not necessary for correctness
% constraint forall (w in 1..max_weeks) (
%     not used[w] -> forall (s in 1..num_scientists) ( assign[w, s] = 1 )
% );

% Output: show the assignments for used weeks only
output [
    "Weeks used: ", show(weeks_used), "\n",
    "Assignments (week, scientist -> team):\n"
] ++ [
    if used[w] then
        show([assign[w, s] | s in 1..num_scientists]) ++ "\n"
    else
        ""
    endif | w in 1..max_weeks
];
