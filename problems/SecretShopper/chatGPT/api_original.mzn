Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
    - `visits`: A 4-dimensional array of boolean variables, where `visits[s, o, p, w]` is true if shopper `s` visits outlet `o` to meet sales person `p` in week `w`.
    - `outlet_areas`: A 2-dimensional array of boolean variables, where `outlet_areas[o, a]` is true if outlet `o` is in area `a`.
    - `sales_people`: An array of integer variables, where `sales_people[o]` is the number of sales people in outlet `o`.

2. Domains:
    - `s` (shopper): 1..40
    - `o` (outlet): 1..19
    - `p` (sales person): 1..4
    - `w` (week): 1..4
    - `a` (area): 1..4

3. Constraints:
    - Each sales person must be visited by 4 different shoppers.
    - Each shopper should only visit 1 outlet in each of the 4 areas.
    - All sales people should be visited 2 times in the first 2 weeks of fieldwork.
    - Shoppers making 4 visits must have done 2 visits by the end of the second week.
    - Shoppers making 3 visits should have done 1 or 2 visits by the end of the second week.

4. This is a satisfaction problem (no objective function).

5. Potential simplifications or modeling choices:
    - We can assume that the number of sales people in each outlet is fixed and known in advance.
    - We can also assume that the area of each outlet is fixed and known in advance.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Number of shoppers, outlets, sales people, weeks, and areas
int: n_shoppers = 40;
int: n_outlets = 19;
int: n_sales_people = 4;
int: n_weeks = 4;
int: n_areas = 4;

% Decision variables
array[1..n_shoppers, 1..n_outlets, 1..n_sales_people, 1..n_weeks] of var 0..1: visits;
array[1..n_outlets, 1..n_areas] of var 0..1: outlet_areas;
array[1..n_outlets] of var 1..n_sales_people: sales_people;

% Each sales person must be visited by 4 different shoppers
constraint forall(o in 1..n_outlets, p in 1..sales_people[o]) (
  sum(s in 1..n_shoppers, w in 1..n_weeks) (visits[s, o, p, w]) = 4
);

% Each shopper should only visit 1 outlet in each of the 4 areas
constraint forall(s in 1..n_shoppers, a in 1..n_areas) (
  sum(o in 1..n_outlets) (outlet_areas[o, a] * sum(p in 1..n_sales_people, w in 1..n_weeks) (visits[s, o, p, w])) = 1
);

% All sales people should be visited 2 times in the first 2 weeks of fieldwork
constraint forall(o in 1..n_outlets, p in 1..sales_people[o]) (
  sum(s in 1..n_shoppers, w in 1..2) (visits[s, o, p, w]) = 2
);

% Shoppers making 4 visits must have done 2 visits by the end of the second week
constraint forall(s in 1..n_shoppers) (
  (sum(o in 1..n_outlets, p in 1..n_sales_people, w in 1..n_weeks) (visits[s, o, p, w]) = 4) -> 
  (sum(o in 1..n_outlets, p in 1..n_sales_people, w in 1..2) (visits[s, o, p, w]) = 2)
);

% Shoppers making 3 visits should have done 1 or 2 visits by the end of the second week
constraint forall(s in 1..n_shoppers) (
  (sum(o in 1..n_outlets, p in 1..n_sales_people, w in 1..n_weeks) (visits[s, o, p, w]) = 3) -> 
  (sum(o in 1..n_outlets, p in 1..n_sales_people, w in 1..2) (visits[s, o, p, w]) >= 1 /\
   sum(o in 1..n_outlets, p in 1..n_sales_people, w in 1..2) (visits[s, o, p, w]) <= 2)
);

solve satisfy;
```

Note: This model assumes that the number of sales people in each outlet and the area of each outlet are given as input. If these are not known in advance, they can be modeled as decision variables with appropriate constraints.
