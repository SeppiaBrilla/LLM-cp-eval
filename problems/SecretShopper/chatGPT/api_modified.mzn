Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
    - The assignment of agents to locations in each zone for each week. This can be represented as a 4-dimensional array `assignment[week, agent, zone, location]` where `week` ranges from 1 to 4, `agent` ranges from 1 to 10, `zone` ranges from 1 to 4, and `location` ranges from 1 to 19. The value of `assignment[week, agent, zone, location]` is 1 if the agent is assigned to the location in the zone for the week, and 0 otherwise.

2. Domains:
    - The domain of `assignment[week, agent, zone, location]` is {0, 1}.

3. Constraints:
    - Each agent visits one location in each zone: For each agent and each week, the sum of `assignment[week, agent, zone, location]` over all locations in each zone should be 1.
    - Each officer receives 4 visits: The sum of `assignment[week, agent, zone, location]` over all weeks, agents, and zones for each location should be equal to the number of officers in the location multiplied by 4.
    - Each officer receives 2 visits in the first 2 weeks: The sum of `assignment[week, agent, zone, location]` over the first 2 weeks, all agents, and zones for each location should be equal to the number of officers in the location multiplied by 2.

4. This is a satisfaction problem as there is no objective function to optimize.

5. Potential simplifications or modeling choices:
    - We can assume that the number of officers in each location is known and fixed. This information can be represented as an array `officers[location]` where `location` ranges from 1 to 19 and `officers[location]` is the number of officers in the location.
    - We can also assume that the zones for each location are known and fixed. This information can be represented as an array `zones[location]` where `location` ranges from 1 to 19 and `zones[location]` is the zone of the location.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Number of officers in each location
array[1..19] of int: officers = [...];

% Zone of each location
array[1..19] of int: zones = [...];

% Assignment of agents to locations
array[1..4, 1..10, 1..4, 1..19] of var 0..1: assignment;

% Each agent visits one location in each zone
constraint forall(week in 1..4, agent in 1..10, zone in 1..4) (
  sum(location in 1..19 where zones[location] = zone) (assignment[week, agent, zone, location]) = 1
);

% Each officer receives 4 visits
constraint forall(location in 1..19) (
  sum(week in 1..4, agent in 1..10, zone in 1..4 where zones[location] = zone) (assignment[week, agent, zone, location]) = officers[location] * 4
);

% Each officer receives 2 visits in the first 2 weeks
constraint forall(location in 1..19) (
  sum(week in 1..2, agent in 1..10, zone in 1..4 where zones[location] = zone) (assignment[week, agent, zone, location]) = officers[location] * 2
);

solve satisfy;
```

Note: The arrays `officers` and `zones` should be filled with the actual data before running the model.
