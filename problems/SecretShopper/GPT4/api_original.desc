Reasoning:

1. **Decision Variables:**
    - The main decision variable is a 3-dimensional array `visit` where `visit[i,j,k]` represents whether shopper `i` visits salesperson `j` in week `k`. This array will be of size `40x35x4` as there are 40 shoppers, 35 salespeople and 4 weeks.
    - Another decision variable is a 2-dimensional array `outlet` where `outlet[i,j]` represents whether shopper `i` visits outlet `j`. This array will be of size `40x19` as there are 40 shoppers and 19 outlets.

2. **Domains:**
    - The domain of `visit` and `outlet` is binary i.e., {0,1}.

3. **Constraints:**
    - Each salesperson must be visited by 4 different shoppers.
    - Each shopper should only visit 1 outlet in each of the 4 areas.
    - All salespeople should be visited 2 times in the first 2 weeks of fieldwork.
    - In each group of shoppers, 5 shoppers will perform 3 visits and the other 5 shoppers will perform 4 visits.
    - Shoppers making 4 visits must have done 2 visits by the end of the second week. Shoppers making 3 visits should have done 1 or 2 visits by the end of the second week.

4. **Objective Function:**
    - This is a satisfaction problem, so there is no objective function to optimize.

5. **Modeling Choices:**
    - We can model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) where the goal is to find an assignment of shoppers to salespeople and outlets that satisfies all the constraints.
    - We can use the global constraint `sum` to ensure that each salesperson is visited by 4 different shoppers and each shopper visits the correct number of salespeople.
    - We can use the global constraint `alldifferent` to ensure that each shopper visits different outlets in each area.
    - We can use the global constraint `count` to ensure that all salespeople are visited 2 times in the first 2 weeks of fieldwork.
    - We can use the global constraint `cumulative` to ensure that the visits are spaced out roughly evenly over the 4 weeks.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the decision variables
var 0..1: visit[1..40, 1..35, 1..4]; % visit[i,j,k] = 1 if shopper i visits salesperson j in week k
var 0..1: outlet[1..40, 1..19]; % outlet[i,j] = 1 if shopper i visits outlet j

% Define the constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..40)(sum(j in 1..35, k in 1..4)(visit[i,j,k]) = if i mod 2 = 0 then 4 else 3 endif); % Each shopper visits the correct number of salespeople
constraint forall(j in 1..35)(sum(i in 1..40, k in 1..4)(visit[i,j,k]) = 4); % Each salesperson is visited by 4 different shoppers
constraint forall(i in 1..40)(sum(j in 1..5)(outlet[i,j]) = 1 /\ sum(j in 6..10)(outlet[i,j]) = 1 /\ sum(j in 11..15)(outlet[i,j]) = 1 /\ sum(j in 16..19)(outlet[i,j]) = 1); % Each shopper visits 1 outlet in each area
constraint forall(j in 1..35)(sum(i in 1..40, k in 1..2)(visit[i,j,k]) = 2); % All salespeople are visited 2 times in the first 2 weeks
constraint forall(i in 1..40)(if i mod 2 = 0 then sum(j in 1..35, k in 1..2)(visit[i,j,k]) = 2 else sum(j in 1..35, k in 1..2)(visit[i,j,k]) >= 1 /\ sum(j in 1..35, k in 1..2)(visit[i,j,k]) <= 2 endif); % Shoppers making 4 visits must have done 2 visits by the end of the second week. Shoppers making 3 visits should have done 1 or 2 visits by the end of the second week
