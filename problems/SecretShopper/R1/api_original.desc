**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Overview**: The problem involves scheduling visits from shoppers to sales people over 4 weeks, with constraints on the number of visits, grouping of shoppers, geographic areas, and timing. The goal is to find a feasible assignment of shoppers and weeks to visits for each sales person.

2. **Key Entities**:
   - 19 outlets grouped into 4 areas: Area 1 (outlets 1-5), Area 2 (6-10), Area 3 (11-15), Area 4 (16-19).
   - 35 sales people distributed across outlets (1-4 per outlet).
   - 40 shoppers divided into 4 groups of 10. Each group has 5 shoppers with 3 visits and 5 with 4 visits.
   - Total visits: 140 (4 per sales person).

3. **Constraints**:
   - Each sales person is visited by 4 different shoppers.
   - Each shopper visits at most one outlet per area (i.e., for each shopper and area, all visited sales people in that area must be from the same outlet).
   - Each sales person must be visited exactly twice in weeks 1-2 and twice in weeks 3-4.
   - For shoppers with 4 visits, exactly 2 visits must be in weeks 1-2 and 2 in weeks 3-4.
   - For shoppers with 3 visits, 1 or 2 visits must be in weeks 1-2 (and the remainder in weeks 3-4).
   - For each sales person, the four visiting shoppers must be from different groups (i.e., all four groups represented).

4. **Modeling Decisions**:
   - Use arrays `visit_shopper` and `visit_week` for each sales person (1-35) and each of their 4 visits. Domains: shoppers 1-40, weeks 1-4.
   - Parameters define the mapping of outlets to areas, sales people to outlets, shopper groups, and visit counts.
   - Constraints ensure:
     - All shoppers for a sales person are distinct.
     - Each shopper's total visits match their visit count.
     - Weekly visit counts per sales person and shopper.
     - Shoppers from different groups per sales person.
     - For each shopper and area, at most one outlet is visited (using distinct outlets per area).

5. **Assumptions**:
   - The exact distribution of sales people per outlet and shopper groups/visit counts is provided as parameters and must satisfy the given totals and ranges.
   - The model is for satisfaction since no optimization objective is specified.

array[1..num_sales_people, 1..4] of var 1..num_weeks: visit_week;

% Constraints

% 1. For each sales person, the four shoppers must be distinct
constraint forall(s in 1..num_sales_people) (
    all_different([visit_shopper[s, v] | v in 1..4])
);

% 2. For each shopper, the total number of visits must match their visit_count
constraint forall(sh in 1..num_shoppers) (
    sum(s in 1..num_sales_people, v in 1..4) (visit_shopper[s, v] == sh) = visit_count[sh]

% 3. For each sales person, exactly two visits in weeks 1-2 and two in weeks 3-4
constraint forall(s in 1..num_sales_people) (
    sum(v in 1..4) (visit_week[s, v] <= 2) = 2

% 4. For each shopper, visits in weeks 1-2 must be 2 if visit_count=4, or 1 or 2 if visit_count=3
constraint forall(sh in 1..num_shoppers) (
    let {
        var int: first_half = sum(s in 1..num_sales_people, v in 1..4) (

% 5. For each sales person, the four shoppers must be from different groups
constraint forall(s in 1..num_sales_people) (
    all_different([group_for_shopper[visit_shopper[s, v]] | v in 1..4])

% 6. For each shopper and each area, at most one outlet is visited in that area
constraint forall(sh in 1..num_shoppers, a in 1..num_areas) (
    card( { outlet_of_salesperson[s] | s in 1..num_sales_people, v in 1..4 
            where visit_shopper[s, v] == sh /\ area_of_outlet[outlet_of_salesperson[s]] == a } ) <= 1
);

% Additional data constraints on parameters (commented out if data is provided separately)
% constraint forall(o in 1..num_outlets) (
%     1 <= sum(s in 1..num_sales_people) (outlet_of_salesperson[s] == o) <= 4

% constraint sum(s in 1..num_sales_people) (1) = num_sales_people;

**Note**: The model includes parameters that must be provided with data satisfying the constraints (e.g., `outlet_of_salesperson`, `group_for_shopper`, `visit_count`). The commented constraints ensure parameter validity if included. The output displays the assignment for each sales person.
