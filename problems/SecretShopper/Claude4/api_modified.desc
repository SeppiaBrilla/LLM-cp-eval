**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - We need to track which agent visits which location in which week
   - Each agent must visit exactly one location per zone over the 4 weeks
   - We need to ensure the visit distribution meets the constraints

2. **Key Constraints Analysis:**
   - 40 agents total (4 groups × 10 agents each)
   - 19 locations with 1-4 officers each, totaling 35 officers
   - Each officer gets exactly 4 visits over 4 weeks (140 total visits)
   - Each officer must get 2 visits in first 2 weeks
   - Each agent visits one location per zone (4 visits total per agent)
   - 40 agents × 4 visits = 160 total agent-visits, but we only need 140 visits to officers

3. **Variables Needed:**
   - `visit[agent, week, location]`: binary variable indicating if agent visits location in given week
   - `officers_per_location[location]`: number of officers at each location (1-4)
   - Zone assignments: Zone 1 (1-5), Zone 2 (6-10), Zone 3 (11-15), Zone 4 (16-19)

4. **Constraints:**
   - Each agent visits exactly one location per week
   - Each agent visits exactly one location per zone over the 4 weeks
   - Total visits to each location × officers at that location = officer visits
   - Each officer gets exactly 2 visits in weeks 1-2 and 2 visits in weeks 3-4
   - Sum of officers across all locations = 35
   - Total officer visits = 140

5. **Modeling Approach:**
   - This is a satisfaction problem (no explicit objective to optimize)
   - We need to find a feasible assignment that satisfies all constraints
   - The constraint about officers per location needs to be satisfied such that total officers = 35
