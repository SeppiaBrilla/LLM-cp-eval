**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - We need to track which agent visits which location in which week
   - Each agent must visit exactly one location per zone over the 4 weeks
   - We need to ensure the visit distribution meets the officer visit requirements

2. **Key Parameters:**
   - 4 zones with locations: Zone 1 (1-5), Zone 2 (6-10), Zone 3 (11-15), Zone 4 (16-19)
   - 40 agents total (4 groups Ã— 10 agents each)
   - 35 officers total across all locations (1-4 officers per location)
   - Each officer needs exactly 4 visits over 4 weeks
   - Each officer needs exactly 2 visits in the first 2 weeks
   - Each agent visits exactly one location per zone (4 visits total per agent)

3. **Decision Variables:**
   - `visit[agent, week, location]`: binary variable indicating if agent visits location in given week
   - We need to track officers per location to ensure visit requirements are met

4. **Constraints:**
   - Each agent visits exactly one location per week
   - Each agent visits exactly one location per zone over all weeks
   - Officer visit requirements: 4 total visits, 2 in first 2 weeks
   - Location capacity constraints (1-4 officers per location, totaling 35)

5. **Modeling Approach:**
   - We'll need to define the number of officers at each location
   - Track visits to ensure each officer gets the required number of visits
   - This is a satisfaction problem (no explicit objective function needed)

**MiniZinc model:**

% Parameters

% Constraint: total officers across all locations = 35

% Decision variable: agent visits location in week

% Constraint: Each agent visits exactly one location per week
constraint forall(a in 1..num_agents, w in 1..num_weeks) (

% Constraint: Each agent visits exactly one location per zone over all weeks

    sum(w in 1..num_weeks, l in zone3)(visit[a, w, l]) = 1 /\
    sum(w in 1..num_weeks, l in zone4)(visit[a, w, l]) = 1
);

% Constraint: Each officer receives exactly 4 visits total
constraint forall(l in 1..num_locations) (
    sum(a in 1..num_agents, w in 1..num_weeks)(visit[a, w, l]) = 
    4 * officers_at_location[l]

% Constraint: Each officer receives exactly 2 visits in first 2 weeks
constraint forall(l in 1..num_locations) (
    sum(a in 1..num_agents, w in 1..2)(visit[a, w, l]) =
