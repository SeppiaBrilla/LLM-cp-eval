Supply vessels transport containers from site to site. The deck area is rectangular. Containers are cuboid, and are laid out in a single layer. All containers are positioned parallel to the sides of the deck. The contents of the containers determine their class. Certain classes of containers are constrained to be separated by minimum distances either due to safety regulations or incompatible materials. The problem is to determine the optimal arrangement of containers on the deck that maximizes the number of containers loaded while respecting all separation constraints and ensuring no container exceeds the deck boundaries.
