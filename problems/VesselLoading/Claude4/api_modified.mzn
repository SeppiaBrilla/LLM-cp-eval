**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine the position of each artwork panel in the 2D gallery space. For each artwork, we need its bottom-left corner coordinates (x, y).

2. **Domains**: 
   - Each artwork has dimensions (width, height) and must fit within the gallery bounds
   - x-coordinates: from 0 to (gallery_width - artwork_width)
   - y-coordinates: from 0 to (gallery_height - artwork_height)

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Non-overlap**: No two artworks can occupy the same space
   - **Gallery bounds**: All artworks must fit completely within the gallery
   - **Category distance rules**: Artworks of certain category pairs must maintain minimum horizontal or vertical separation
   - **Impact space**: Each artwork needs its specified cuboid space (this seems to be captured by the artwork dimensions)

4. **Problem Type**: This is a satisfaction problem - we want to determine if a valid arrangement exists, not optimize any particular objective.

5. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Use 2D rectangle packing with additional distance constraints
   - Model artworks as rectangles with bottom-left corner positioning
   - Distance constraints can be modeled using disjunctive constraints (either sufficient horizontal OR vertical separation)

**MiniZinc Model:**

% Museum Gallery Artwork Placement Problem

% Gallery dimensions
int: gallery_width;
int: gallery_height;

% Number of artworks
int: n_artworks;

% Artwork properties
array[1..n_artworks] of int: width;   % artwork widths

% Distance requirements between categories

% Decision variables: bottom-left corner coordinates of each artwork
array[1..n_artworks] of var 0..gallery_width: x;
array[1..n_artworks] of var 0..gallery_height: y;

% Constraint: artworks must fit within gallery bounds
constraint forall(i in 1..n_artworks) (
    x[i] + width[i] <= gallery_width /\
    y[i] + height[i] <= gallery_height
);

% Constraint: no two artworks can overlap
constraint forall(i, j in 1..n_artworks where i < j) (
    x[i] + width[i] <= x[j] \/    % i is left of j
    x[j] + width[j] <= x[i] \/    % j is left of i  
    y[i] + height[i] <= y[j] \/   % i is below j
    y[j] + height[j] <= y[i]      % j is below i
);

% Constraint: category distance rules
constraint forall(r in 1..n_distance_rules) (
    forall(i, j in 1..n_artworks where 
           i != j /\ 
           ((category[i] = cat1[r] /\ category[j] = cat2[r]) \/
            (category[i] = cat2[r] /\ category[j] = cat1[r]))) (
        % Either sufficient horizontal distance OR sufficient vertical distance
        abs(x[i] - x[j]) >= min_distance[r] \/
        abs(y[i] - y[j]) >= min_distance[r]
    )

solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
