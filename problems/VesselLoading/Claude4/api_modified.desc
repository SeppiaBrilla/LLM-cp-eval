**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine the position of each artwork panel in the 2D gallery space. For each artwork, we need its bottom-left corner coordinates (x, y) since panels are rectangular and aligned with walls.

2. **Domains**: 
   - Each artwork has width and height dimensions
   - Gallery has fixed width and height boundaries
   - Position coordinates must ensure artworks fit entirely within the gallery
   - Coordinates are typically non-negative integers (assuming discrete grid positioning)

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Boundary constraints**: Each artwork must fit completely within the gallery (position + dimensions â‰¤ gallery dimensions)
   - **Non-overlap constraints**: No two artworks can occupy the same space
   - **Distance constraints**: Artworks of certain category pairs must maintain minimum horizontal or vertical separation
   - **Impact space**: Each artwork needs its specified cuboid space (this seems to be captured by the artwork dimensions)

4. **Problem Type**: This is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) - we want to determine if a feasible arrangement exists, not optimize any particular objective.

5. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Use 2D coordinates for bottom-left corners of rectangles
   - Model non-overlap using disjunctive constraints (either separated horizontally OR vertically)
   - Distance constraints can be modeled similarly but with minimum separation requirements
   - Need to handle both horizontal and vertical distance requirements between category pairs
