**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - For each container i, we need variables for its position: `x[i]` and `y[i]` representing the coordinates of one corner (e.g., bottom-left)
   - We also need to decide the orientation of each container: `rotated[i]` (boolean) indicating if container i is rotated 90 degrees

2. **Domains:**
   - Position variables: `x[i]` in `0..deck_width`, `y[i]` in `0..deck_height`
   - The actual bounds depend on container dimensions and rotation
   - Rotation variables: `rotated[i]` is boolean

3. **Constraints:**
   - **Boundary constraints:** Each container must fit entirely within the deck boundaries
   - **Non-overlapping constraints:** No two containers can overlap
   - **Separation constraints:** Containers of certain classes must maintain minimum distances along x-axis (across deck) and y-axis (along deck)

4. **Key modeling decisions:**
   - Use bottom-left corner as reference point for each container
   - Handle rotation by swapping width/height when `rotated[i]` is true
   - For separation constraints, we need to consider the distance between container boundaries, not just their reference points

5. **Problem type:** This is a satisfaction problem - we want to determine if a feasible placement exists.

6. **Potential complexities:**
   - Need to handle rotated dimensions properly
   - Separation constraints require careful distance calculations between container boundaries
   - Non-overlapping constraints for rectangles can be complex but MiniZinc has built-in support

**MiniZinc model:**
