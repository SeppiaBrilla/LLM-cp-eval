Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The position of each artwork in the gallery. This can be represented as a 2D array of integers, where each cell represents a position in the gallery and the integer value represents the artwork placed at that position. The value 0 can be used to represent an empty space.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of each cell in the 2D array is the set of all artwork IDs plus 0 (representing an empty space). The number of artworks is given as input.

3. Constraints:
   - Each artwork must be placed in a unique position in the gallery. This can be enforced by ensuring that each artwork ID appears exactly once in the 2D array.
   - The size of each artwork must be respected. This can be enforced by ensuring that the artwork fits within the dimensions of the gallery.
   - The distance rules between artworks must be respected. This can be enforced by ensuring that for each pair of artworks that must be distanced, the Manhattan distance between their positions is at least the required distance.
   - The impact space of each artwork must be respected. This can be enforced by ensuring that for each artwork, the surrounding cells within the impact radius are empty.

4. Objective Function:
   - This is a satisfaction problem. The objective is to find a valid arrangement of artworks in the gallery, if one exists.

5. Potential Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - The problem can be simplified by assuming that the gallery is large enough to accommodate all artworks. If this is not the case, the problem becomes infeasible.
   - The problem can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), where the goal is to find an assignment of values to variables that satisfies all constraints.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the parameters
int: n; % number of artworks
set of int: ARTWORKS = 1..n;
int: w; % width of the gallery
int: h; % height of the gallery
array[ARTWORKS] of int: size; % size of each artwork
array[ARTWORKS] of int: impact; % impact space of each artwork
array[ARTWORKS, ARTWORKS] of int: distance; % distance rules between artworks

% Define the decision variables
array[1..w, 1..h] of var 0..n: gallery;

% Each artwork must be placed in a unique position in the gallery
constraint forall(i in ARTWORKS)(sum([gallery[x, y] = i | x in 1..w, y in 1..h]) = 1);

% The size of each artwork must be respected
constraint forall(i in ARTWORKS, x in 1..w, y in 1..h)(if gallery[x, y] = i then x + size[i] <= w /\ y + size[i] <= h else true endif);

% The distance rules between artworks must be respected
constraint forall(i in ARTWORKS, j in ARTWORKS where i < j, x1 in 1..w, y1 in 1..h, x2 in 1..w, y2 in 1..h)(if gallery[x1, y1] = i /\ gallery[x2, y2] = j then abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) >= distance[i, j] else true endif);

% The impact space of each artwork must be respected
constraint forall(i in ARTWORKS, x in 1..w, y in 1..h)(if gallery[x, y] = i then forall(dx in -impact[i]..impact[i], dy in -impact[i]..impact[i])(x + dx >= 1 /\ x + dx <= w /\ y + dy >= 1 /\ y + dy <= h -> gallery[x + dx, y + dy] = 0) else true endif);

% Solve the problem
solve satisfy;
```

This model assumes that the size and impact space of each artwork are represented as the length of a side of a square, and that the distance rules are represented as the Manhattan distance between the centers of the artworks. The model also assumes that the gallery is large enough to accommodate all artworks. If this is not the case, the problem becomes infeasible.
