Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables: The decision variables are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner of each artwork in the gallery. These are integer variables, as we assume that the coordinates are given in a discrete grid (e.g., centimeters). We will denote these variables as `x[i]` and `y[i]` for each artwork `i`.

2. Domains: The domains of the `x[i]` and `y[i]` variables are determined by the size of the gallery. If the gallery is `W` units wide and `H` units high, then `x[i]` is in the range `1..W` and `y[i]` is in the range `1..H`.

3. Constraints: There are several types of constraints in this problem:
   - **Non-overlap constraints**: Each pair of artworks `(i, j)` must not overlap. This can be expressed as a disjunction of four conditions: either artwork `i` is to the left of artwork `j`, or to the right, or above, or below.
   - **Distance constraints**: For each pair of artworks `(i, j)` that belong to categories that must be distanced, the Manhattan distance between `i` and `j` must be at least the required distance.
   - **Size constraints**: Each artwork must fit within the gallery. This means that `x[i] + width[i] <= W` and `y[i] + height[i] <= H` for each artwork `i`.

4. This is a satisfaction problem, as we are only interested in finding a feasible arrangement of the artworks, not in optimizing any objective.

5. Potential simplifications or modeling choices: If the number of artworks is large, it may be beneficial to use a global constraint such as `cumulative` to handle the non-overlap constraints. However, this would require transforming the problem into a scheduling problem, which may complicate the model. For simplicity, we will use a straightforward approach based on pairwise constraints.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Parameters
int: W; % Width of the gallery
int: H; % Height of the gallery
set of int: ARTWORKS; % Set of artworks
array[ARTWORKS] of int: width; % Width of each artwork
array[ARTWORKS] of int: height; % Height of each artwork
array[ARTWORKS, ARTWORKS] of int: dist; % Required distance between each pair of artworks

% Decision variables
array[ARTWORKS] of var 1..W: x; % x-coordinate of each artwork
array[ARTWORKS] of var 1..H: y; % y-coordinate of each artwork

% Constraints
constraint forall(i in ARTWORKS)(
  x[i] + width[i] <= W /\ y[i] + height[i] <= H
);

constraint forall(i in ARTWORKS, j in ARTWORKS where i < j)(
  x[i] + width[i] <= x[j] \/ x[j] + width[j] <= x[i] \/
  y[i] + height[i] <= y[j] \/ y[j] + height[j] <= y[i]
);

constraint forall(i in ARTWORKS, j in ARTWORKS where i != j)(
  abs(x[i] - x[j]) + abs(y[i] - y[j]) >= dist[i, j]
);

% Solve
solve satisfy;
```

This model assumes that the `dist` array is symmetric and that `dist[i, i] = 0` for all `i`. If the distance requirements are not symmetric or if there are non-zero distances between artworks of the same category, the model would need to be adjusted accordingly.
