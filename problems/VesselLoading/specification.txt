original:
Supply vessels transport containers from site to site. The deck area is rectangular. Containers are cuboid, and are laid out in a single layer. All containers are positioned parallel to the sides of the deck. The contents of the containers determine their class. Certain classes of containers are constrained to be separated by minimum distances either along the deck or across the deck. The vessel loading decision problem is to determine whether a given set of containers can be positioned on a given deck, without overlapping, and without violating any of the separation constraints. The problem can be modelled as packing of a set of rectangles into a larger rectangle, subject to constraints.

A museum is curating a special exhibition in a large rectangular gallery hall. Artworks arrive in the form of framed panels, each that need a cuboid space to be placed such as to maximise its impact. The panels are displayed on the gallery floor in a single layer, aligned with the walls of the room. Each artwork belongs to a specific thematic category. For curatorial and safety reasons, some categories of artworks must be distanced by a specific amount, horizontally or vertically. The problem is to decide whether all artworks can be arranged within the gallery space without overlap and without violating the distance rules while also respecting the space reserved to maximise their impact.
