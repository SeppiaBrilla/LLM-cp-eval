Supply vessels transport containers from site to site. The deck area is rectangular. Containers are cuboid, and are laid out in a single layer. All containers are positioned parallel to the sides of the deck. The contents of the containers determine their class. Certain classes of containers are constrained to be separated by minimum distances e_i from each other. The problem is to find a packing of all containers into the deck such that no two containers overlap and for each constrained class, the distance between any two containers of that class is at least e_i.
