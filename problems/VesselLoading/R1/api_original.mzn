**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves packing rectangular containers onto a rectangular deck without overlapping and while satisfying separation constraints between certain classes of containers. This is a satisfaction problem (checking feasibility), not optimization.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Deck**: A rectangle with given width and length.
   - **Containers**: Each has a width, length, and class. They must be placed parallel to the deck edges (no rotations).
   - **Separation Constraints**: For certain pairs of classes, minimum distances must be maintained either along the deck (x-direction) or across the deck (y-direction). These are specified via matrices for x and y distances.

3. **Decision Variables**:
   - For each container, define `x[i]` and `y[i]` as the bottom-left coordinates on the deck.
   - Domains: `x[i]` ranges from 0 to `deck_width` (but constrained to ensure the container fits within width), and similarly for `y[i]` with length.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Within Deck**: Each container must fully fit within the deck boundaries.
   - **Non-Overlapping**: For any two distinct containers, they must not overlap. This is enforced by ensuring separation in at least one direction (x or y).
   - **Separation**: For pairs of containers with classes having minimum distance constraints in x or y, enforce that the gap between their projections is at least the specified distance. This is applied conditionally based on the class pairs.

5. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Use arrays for container dimensions and classes.
   - Use 2D arrays for minimum distances between class pairs, with 0 indicating no constraint.
   - Apply non-overlap constraints to all container pairs, and separation constraints only when the minimum distance is positive.
   - Use implications to conditionally enforce separation constraints.

6. **Simplifications**: Assume separation constraints are symmetric (i.e., min_x[c1,c2] = min_x[c2,c1]), and no container rotations are allowed.
