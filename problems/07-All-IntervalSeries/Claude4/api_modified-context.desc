**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine the order in which to process the DNA samples. This means we need a sequence of n positions, where each position contains one of the sample labels (0 to n-1).

2. **Variable Domains**: 
   - Let `s[i]` represent the sample processed at position i, where i ranges from 1 to n
   - Each `s[i]` must be in the range 0 to n-1
   - The sequence s must be a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}

3. **Constraints to Encode**:
   - **Unique Processing**: Each sample appears exactly once in the sequence (permutation constraint)
   - **Unique Differences**: The absolute differences between consecutive samples must form a permutation of {1, 2, ..., n-1}
   - This means we need n-1 difference values, and each value from 1 to n-1 must appear exactly once

4. **Problem Type**: This is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) - we're looking for any valid sequence that satisfies the constraints, not optimizing an objective function.

5. **Modeling Choices**: 
   - Use an array `s` of length n to represent the processing sequence
   - Use an array `diffs` of length n-1 to represent the absolute differences
   - Apply `all_different` constraints to ensure both arrays represent permutations
   - Link the difference array to the sequence array through absolute value constraints

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% DNA Sample Processing Order Problem
% Find a permutation of samples such that consecutive differences are also a permutation

include "globals.mzn";

% Problem parameters
int: n; % number of DNA samples (0 to n-1)

% Decision variables
array[1..n] of var 0..n-1: s;        % sequence of samples to process
array[1..n-1] of var 1..n-1: diffs;  % absolute differences between consecutive samples

% Constraints

% Each sample must be processed exactly once (permutation of samples)
constraint all_different(s);

% The differences must cover all values from 1 to n-1 exactly once
constraint all_different(diffs);

% Link the differences to the sequence
constraint forall(i in 1..n-1) (
    diffs[i] = abs(s[i+1] - s[i])
);

% Solve the constraint satisfaction problem
solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
output [
    "Processing order: " ++ show(s) ++ "\n" ++
    "Differences: " ++ show(diffs) ++ "\n"
];
