**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine the order in which to process the DNA samples. This means we need a sequence of n positions, where each position contains one of the sample labels (0 to n-1).

2. **Variable Domains**: 
   - Let `s[i]` represent the sample processed at position i (for i = 1 to n)
   - Each `s[i]` has domain {0, 1, ..., n-1}
   - We also need variables for the absolute differences between consecutive samples
   - Let `diff[i]` represent |s[i+1] - s[i]| for i = 1 to n-1
   - Each `diff[i]` has domain {1, 2, ..., n-1}

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Unique Processing**: The sequence s must be a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, meaning each sample appears exactly once
   - **Unique Differences**: The differences between consecutive samples must form a permutation of {1, 2, ..., n-1}, meaning each difference value from 1 to n-1 appears exactly once
   - **Difference Calculation**: We need to properly calculate the absolute differences: diff[i] = |s[i+1] - s[i]|

4. **Problem Type**: This is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) - we're looking for any valid sequence that satisfies all constraints, not optimizing any particular objective.

5. **Modeling Considerations**: 
   - We can use MiniZinc's `alldifferent` constraint to ensure both the sample sequence and difference sequence are permutations
   - For absolute value calculation, we can use MiniZinc's `abs` function
   - The problem is essentially finding a Hamiltonian path in a complete graph where edge weights correspond to the required differences

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% DNA Sample Processing Order Problem
% Find a permutation of samples such that consecutive differences are also a permutation

% Number of DNA samples
int: n;

% Decision variables: sequence of samples to process
array[1..n] of var 0..n-1: s;

% Auxiliary variables: absolute differences between consecutive samples  
array[1..n-1] of var 1..n-1: diff;

% Constraint 1: Each sample must be processed exactly once (permutation)
constraint alldifferent(s);

% Constraint 2: Calculate absolute differences between consecutive samples
constraint forall(i in 1..n-1) (
    diff[i] = abs(s[i+1] - s[i])
);

% Constraint 3: All differences must be unique and cover {1, 2, ..., n-1}
constraint alldifferent(diff);

% Solve the constraint satisfaction problem
solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
output [
    "Sample processing order: " ++ show(s) ++ "\n" ++
    "Consecutive differences: " ++ show(diff) ++ "\n"
];
