Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The series `s` is a permutation of Zn=0,1,...,n−1. This is the main decision variable.
   - The interval vector `v` is a permutation of Zn∖{0}={1,2,...,n−1}. This is derived from `s`.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of `s` is the set of integers from 0 to n-1.
   - The domain of `v` is the set of integers from 1 to n-1.

3. Constraints:
   - `s` is a permutation of Zn=0,1,...,n−1. This means that each integer from 0 to n-1 must appear exactly once in `s`.
   - `v` is a permutation of Zn∖{0}={1,2,...,n−1}. This means that each integer from 1 to n-1 must appear exactly once in `v`.
   - The elements of `v` are the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `s`. This can be encoded as a constraint.

4. This is a satisfaction problem. There is no objective function to optimize.

5. Potential Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - The problem can be simplified by treating `s` and `v` as arrays of integers, and using the `alldifferent` global constraint to ensure that they are permutations of their respective sets.
   - The constraint linking `s` and `v` can be encoded using a loop over the indices of the arrays.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% The size of the problem
int: n = 12;

% The series s
array[1..n] of var 0..n-1: s;

% The interval vector v
array[1..n-1] of var 1..n-1: v;

% s is a permutation of 0..n-1
constraint alldifferent(s);

% v is a permutation of 1..n-1
constraint alldifferent(v);

% The elements of v are the absolute differences between consecutive elements of s
constraint forall(i in 1..n-1) (
  v[i] = abs(s[i+1] - s[i])
);

% Find a solution
solve satisfy;
```

This model will find a series `s` and an interval vector `v` that satisfy the given conditions. The `alldifferent` constraint ensures that `s` and `v` are permutations of their respective sets, and the loop over the indices of the arrays encodes the relationship between `s` and `v`. The `solve satisfy` statement tells MiniZinc to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints.
