s is known as the all-interval twelve-tone row problem in music theory and combinatorics. This problem is a significant challenge in the field of music composition and theory, as it requires the creation of a sequence that not only includes all twelve pitch-classes without repetition, but also incorporates all eleven possible musical intervals in a way that maintains the integrity of the series.
