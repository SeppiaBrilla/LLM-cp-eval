**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Understanding**: The company needs to produce multiple knapsacks of different sizes, each capable of holding items. Accessories can be added to increase the item-carrying capacity of each knapsack, but they are subject to constraints from sewing stations and compatibility between accessories. The goal is to maximize the total capacity of all knapsacks, considering their sizes and the efficiency gains from accessories.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Knapsacks**: There are `N` knapsacks, each with a given size `S[i]`.
   - **Accessories**: There are `M` accessories, each with an efficiency multiplier `E[j]` that scales the knapsack's size to increase capacity. For example, if accessory `j` is attached to knapsack `i`, the capacity increases by `E[j] * S[i]`.
   - **Sewing Stations**: Each accessory `j` has a sewing station that can handle at most `P[j]` percent of the knapsacks. Thus, the number of knapsacks with accessory `j` cannot exceed `(P[j] * N) div 100` (using integer division to ensure the percentage is not exceeded).
   - **Accessory Compatibility**: Some pairs of accessories are incompatible and cannot be used on the same knapsack. This is represented as a set of pairs `(j,k)` where both cannot be attached together.

3. **Objective Function**: Maximize the total capacity of all knapsacks. The capacity of knapsack `i` is `S[i] * (1 + sum_{j} E[j] * A[i,j])`, so the total capacity is `sum_i S[i] + sum_j E[j] * (sum_i S[i] * A[i,j])`. Since `sum_i S[i]` is constant, we maximize `sum_j E[j] * T_j` where `T_j = sum_i S[i] * A[i,j]` is the total size-weighted usage of accessory `j`.

4. **Decision Variables**: A binary variable `A[i,j]` for each knapsack `i` and accessory `j`, indicating whether accessory `j` is attached to knapsack `i`.

5. **Constraints**:
   - **Sewing Station Constraints**: For each accessory `j`, the number of knapsacks with `j` is at most `(P[j] * N) div 100`.
   - **Compatibility Constraints**: For each knapsack `i` and each incompatible pair `(j,k)`, `A[i,j]` and `A[i,k]` cannot both be 1.

6. **Model Type**: This is a linear optimization problem with binary variables and linear constraints.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Knapsack Accessory Assignment Problem
% Parameters
int: N; % number of knapsacks
int: M; % number of accessories
set of int: Knapsacks = 1..N;
set of int: Accessories = 1..M;

array[Knapsacks] of float: S; % sizes of knapsacks
array[Accessories] of float: E; % efficiency multipliers of accessories
array[Accessories] of int: P; % percentage limits for sewing stations (0..100)

% Set of incompatible accessory pairs (each pair (j,k) means j and k cannot be together)
set of tuple(Accessories, Accessories): IncompatiblePairs;

% Decision variables: A[i,j] = true if accessory j is attached to knapsack i
array[Knapsacks, Accessories] of var bool: A;

% Sewing station constraints: for each accessory, at most P[j]% of knapsacks can have it
constraint forall(j in Accessories) (
    sum(i in Knapsacks) (A[i,j]) <= (P[j] * N) div 100
);

% Compatibility constraints: for each knapsack, no incompatible pairs are both attached
constraint forall(i in Knapsacks) (
    forall((j,k) in IncompatiblePairs) (
        A[i,j] + A[i,k] <= 1
    )
);

% Objective: maximize total capacity gain from accessories
% The gain is sum over all knapsacks and accessories of E[j] * S[i] * A[i,j]
solve maximize sum(i in Knapsacks, j in Accessories) (E[j] * S[i] * A[i,j]);

% Output (optional): show the assignment for each knapsack
output [
    if j == 1 then "\nKnapsack " ++ show(i) ++ ": " else "" endif ++
    if fix(A[i,j]) then show(j) else "" endif
    | i in Knapsacks, j in Accessories
];
```

**Notes:**
- The model uses `div` for integer division in the sewing station constraints to ensure the number of knapsacks with an accessory does not exceed the percentage limit.
- The objective function maximizes the total capacity gain, which is the sum of `E[j] * S[i] * A[i,j]` over all knapsacks and accessories.
- The output section is included to display which accessories are assigned to each knapsack after solving. It can be modified or removed as needed.
- This model assumes that sizes `S` and efficiency multipliers `E` are given as floats, but they can be integers if appropriate.
