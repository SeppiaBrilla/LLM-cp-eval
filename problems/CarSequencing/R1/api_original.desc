**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis:** The problem requires sequencing a set of cars, each with specific options, such that for each option, the cars requiring it are not bunched together beyond the capacity of the corresponding station. Each station has a capacity defined by parameters \(m_o\) and \(k_o\), meaning that in every consecutive sequence of \(k_o\) cars, at most \(m_o\) cars can require option \(o\).

2. **Key Components:**
   - **Cars and Options:** There are \(n\) cars and \(m\) options. Each car may require multiple options.
   - **Capacity Constraints:** For each option \(o\), the station can handle at most \(m_o\) cars in any \(k_o\) consecutive cars. This prevents bunching and ensures the station's capacity is not exceeded.
   - **Sequence Requirement:** The goal is to find a sequence (permutation) of cars that satisfies all capacity constraints for all options.

3. **Modeling Decisions:**
   - **Variables:** Use a sequence array `seq` where `seq[i]` represents the car at position \(i\). This must be a permutation of all cars.
   - **Constraints:** 
     - The `all_different` constraint ensures each car appears exactly once.
     - For each option \(o\) and each starting position \(s\) in the sequence, the number of cars requiring \(o\) in the window of size \(k_o\) starting at \(s\) must be at most \(m_o\). This is enforced using a sum over the window with `bool2int` to convert boolean requirements to integers.
   - **Satisfaction Problem:** Since no optimization is mentioned, the model is a satisfaction problem.

4. **Input Parameters:** The model expects:
   - `n_cars`: Number of cars.
   - `n_options`: Number of options.
   - `m`: Array of \(m_o\) values for each option.
   - `k`: Array of \(k_o\) values for each option.
   - `requires`: A 2D boolean array where `requires[c, o]` is true if car \(c\) requires option \(o\).

5. **Assumptions:** The parameters \(m_o\) and \(k_o\) are provided for each option, derived from the station's capacity percentage (e.g., for 50% capacity, \(m_o = 1\), \(k_o = 2\)).

**MiniZinc Model:**

% Car Sequencing Problem
% Parameters:
%   n_cars: number of cars to sequence
%   n_options: number of available options
%   m: for each option, the maximum number of cars with that option in any window of size k[o]
%   k: for each option, the window size for the capacity constraint
%   requires: a matrix where requires[c, o] is true if car c requires option o

int: n_cars;
int: n_options;
array[1..n_options] of int: m;
array[1..n_options] of int: k;
array[1..n_cars, 1..n_options] of bool: requires;

% Decision variable: sequence of cars, where seq[i] is the car at position i
array[1..n_cars] of var 1..n_cars: seq;

% Constraint: all cars must appear exactly once in the sequence
constraint all_different(seq);

% Constraints for each option: in every consecutive window of k[o] cars, at most m[o] cars require the option
constraint forall(o in 1..n_options) (
    forall(s in 1..(n_cars - k[o] + 1)) (
        sum(j in s..s + k[o] - 1) (
            bool2int(requires[seq[j], o])
        ) <= m[o]
    )
);

% Solve: satisfy the constraints (find any feasible sequence)
solve satisfy;

% Output: display the sequence of cars
output ["Sequence: "] ++ [show(seq[i]) ++ " " | i in 1..n_cars];
