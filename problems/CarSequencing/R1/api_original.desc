### Reasoning

1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - We have a set of cars, each with a specific set of options (e.g., air-conditioning, sun-roof). 
   - Each option corresponds to a station on the assembly line with a capacity constraint: it can handle at most a certain percentage of cars requiring that option in any consecutive group. 
   - To prevent bunching, for each option, the sequence must ensure that in every consecutive group of size \(N_o\) (derived from the capacity percentage), at most \(M_o\) cars require that option, where \(M_o / N_o = p\) (the capacity percentage).

2. **Key Elements**:
   - **Cars**: Identified by indices 1 to \(C\), where \(C\) is the total number of cars.
   - **Options**: Identified by indices 1 to \(O\), where \(O\) is the total number of options.
   - **Requirement Matrix**: A binary matrix `req` of size \(C \times O\), where `req[i, o] = 1` if car \(i\) requires option \(o\), else 0.
   - **Capacity Parameters**: For each option \(o\), we are given \(M_o\) (maximum number of cars with the option in any consecutive \(N_o\) cars) and \(N_o\) (window size), such that \(M_o / N_o\) equals the capacity percentage.

3. **Decision Variables**:
   - A sequence `seq` of length \(C\), where `seq[i]` is the car at position \(i\). Since each car appears exactly once, `seq` must be a permutation of 1 to \(C\).

4. **Constraints**:
   - **AllDifferent**: Ensure `seq` is a permutation of cars.
   - **Capacity Constraints**: For each option \(o\) and each starting position \(s\) from 1 to \(C - N_o + 1\), the number of cars requiring option \(o\) in positions \(s\) to \(s + N_o - 1\) must be at most \(M_o\). If \(N_o > C\), no constraints are added for that option (as there are no consecutive groups of size \(N_o\)).

5. **Problem Type**: This is a satisfaction problem (find any feasible sequence), so we use `solve satisfy`.

### MiniZinc Model

```minizinc
% Car Sequencing Problem
% Parameters
int: C; % Number of cars
int: O; % Number of options
array[1..C, 1..O] of int: req; % Requirement matrix: req[i, o] = 1 if car i requires option o, else 0
array[1..O] of int: M; % For each option o, maximum number of cars with option o in any consecutive N[o] cars
array[1..O] of int: N; % For each option o, window size for capacity constraint

% Decision variable: sequence of cars
array[1..C] of var 1..C: seq;

% Constraint: seq must be a permutation of cars 1..C
constraint alldifferent(seq);

% Constraint: For each option, in every consecutive block of N[o] cars, at most M[o] cars require the option
constraint forall(o in 1..O) (
    forall(s in 1..C - N[o] + 1) (
        sum(i in s..s + N[o] - 1) (req[seq[i], o]) <= M[o]
    )
);

% Solve: find any feasible sequence
solve satisfy;

% Output the sequence (optional)
output ["Sequence: "] ++ [show(seq[i]) ++ " " | i in 1..C];
