original:
A number of cars are to be produced; they are not identical, because different options are available as variants on the basic model. The assembly line has different stations which install the various options (air-conditioning, sun-roof, etc.). These stations have been designed to handle at most a certain percentage of the cars passing along the assembly line. Furthermore, the cars requiring a certain option must not be bunched together, otherwise the station will not be able to cope. Consequently, the cars must be arranged in a sequence so that the capacity of each station is never exceeded. For instance, if a particular station can only cope with at most half of the cars passing along the line, the sequence must be built so that at most 1 car in any 2 requires that option. The problem has been shown to be NP-complete (Gent 1999).

A company must make a certain number of different knapsacks of different sized and with different accessories so that they can maximise the amount of items each knapsack can contain with respect to its size. The company has different sewing stations to sew the different accessories (space for a water bottle, extra zip, etc.). Each station can handle at most a certain percentage of knapsacks, furthermore, some accessories cannot go together otherwise there won't be enough space left. We don't want to exceed the amount of knapsacks each sewing station can handle. For example, if a station can only handle half of the knapsacks then at most 3 every 6 knapsacks can go there.
