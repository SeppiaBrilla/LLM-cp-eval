A number of cars are to be produced; they are not identical, because different options are available as variants on the basic model. The assembly line has different stations which install the various options (air-conditioning, sun-roof, etc.). These stations have been designed to handle at most a certain percentage of the cars passing along the assembly line. Furthermore, the cars requiring a certain option must not be bunched together, otherwise the station will not be able to cope. Consequently, the cars must be arranged in a sequence such that the capacity constraints of each station are satisfied and the cars are distributed evenly enough to avoid overloading any station with too many consecutive cars requiring the same option.
