Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - A 2D array `facade` of size `n x m` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. Each element of the array can be either 0 or 1, where 0 represents a blank tile and 1 represents a filled tile.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of each element in the `facade` array is {0, 1}.

3. Constraints:
   - For each row and column, the sequence of filled tiles must match the given pattern. This can be achieved by creating a function that checks if a given sequence of 0s and 1s matches a given pattern.
   - The function should iterate over the sequence and count the number of consecutive 1s. If the count matches the current element in the pattern, it should move to the next element in the pattern. If the count exceeds the current element in the pattern, it should return false. If the function reaches the end of the sequence and there are still elements left in the pattern, it should return false. Otherwise, it should return true.

4. This is a satisfaction problem, as we are not trying to optimize any objective function.

5. Potential Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - We can assume that the patterns for the rows and columns are given as input to the model. This simplifies the problem as we do not need to infer the patterns from the facade.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
include "globals.mzn";

% Define the size of the facade
int: n; % number of rows
int: m; % number of columns

% Define the patterns for the rows and columns
array[1..n] of set of int: row_patterns;
array[1..m] of set of int: col_patterns;

% Define the facade
array[1..n, 1..m] of var 0..1: facade;

% Define a function that checks if a sequence matches a pattern
function var bool: matches_pattern(array[int] of var int: sequence, set of int: pattern) =
  let {
    int: len = length(sequence),
    int: p_len = card(pattern),
    var int: count = 0,
    var int: p_index = 1
  } in
  forall(i in 1..len) (
    if sequence[i] = 1 then (
      count = count + 1;
      if count > pattern[p_index] then false
      elseif count = pattern[p_index] then (
        count = 0;
        p_index = p_index + 1;
        if p_index > p_len then false
        else true
      )
      else true
    )
    else (
      count = 0;
      true
    )
  ) /\ p_index = p_len + 1;

% Add constraints for the rows
constraint forall(i in 1..n) (
  matches_pattern([facade[i, j] | j in 1..m], row_patterns[i])
);

% Add constraints for the columns
constraint forall(j in 1..m) (
  matches_pattern([facade[i, j] | i in 1..n], col_patterns[j])
);

% Solve the model
solve satisfy;
```

This model assumes that the patterns for the rows and columns are given as input. The `matches_pattern` function checks if a sequence of 0s and 1s matches a given pattern. The constraints ensure that the sequences of filled tiles in each row and column match the given patterns. The model is solved for satisfaction, as we are not trying to optimize any objective function.
