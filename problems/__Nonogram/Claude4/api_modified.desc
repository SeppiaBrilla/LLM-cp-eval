**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need binary variables to represent whether each tile in the grid is filled (1) or blank (0). Let's call this a 2D array `grid[i,j]` where `i` is the row and `j` is the column.

2. **Input Parameters**: We need to specify:
   - Grid dimensions (rows and columns)
   - Row constraints: for each row, a sequence of consecutive block lengths
   - Column constraints: for each column, a sequence of consecutive block lengths

3. **Constraint Modeling**: For each row and column, we need to ensure that:
   - The filled tiles form exactly the specified number of consecutive blocks
   - Each block has exactly the required length
   - Blocks are separated by at least one blank tile
   - The blocks appear in the specified order

4. **Constraint Implementation Strategy**: 
   - For each row/column constraint, we can use a regular expression or automaton approach
   - Alternatively, we can model this by identifying the start positions of each block and ensuring proper spacing
   - The regular expression approach is cleaner: for a constraint like (3,1,2), the pattern would be: `0* 1{3} 0+ 1{1} 0+ 1{2} 0*` (zero or more blanks, exactly 3 filled, one or more blanks, exactly 1 filled, one or more blanks, exactly 2 filled, zero or more blanks)

5. **Objective**: This appears to be a constraint satisfaction problem rather than an optimization problem, so we just need to find a feasible solution.

6. **MiniZinc Implementation**: We'll use the `regular` constraint with appropriate automata to enforce the consecutive block patterns for each row and column.

**MiniZinc model:**
