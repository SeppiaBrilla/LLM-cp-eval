Nonograms are a popular puzzle, which goes by different names in different countries. Solvers have to shade in squares in a grid so that blocks of consecutive shaded squares satisfy constraints given for each row and column. The constraints specify the lengths of consecutive shaded blocks that must appear in that row or column, in the given order, with at least one unshaded square between different blocks.
