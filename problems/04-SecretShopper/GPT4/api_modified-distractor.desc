Reasoning:

1. **Decision Variables**: 
    - The main decision variable is the assignment of agents to locations and officers. This can be represented as a 4-dimensional array `visit[agent, week, zone, location]` where `agent` is the agent group, `week` is the week of observation, `zone` is the city zone, and `location` is the location within the zone. The value of `visit[agent, week, zone, location]` is the officer that the agent group visits at the location in the zone during the week.

2. **Domains**: 
    - The domain of `agent` is {1,2,3,4} representing the 4 agent groups.
    - The domain of `week` is {1,2,3,4} representing the 4 weeks of observation.
    - The domain of `zone` is {1,2,3,4} representing the 4 city zones.
    - The domain of `location` is {1,2,3,4,5} for zone 1, {1,2,3,4,5} for zone 2, {1,2,3,4,5} for zone 3, and {1,2,3,4} for zone 4.
    - The domain of `visit[agent, week, zone, location]` is {1,2,3,...,35} representing the 35 officers.

3. **Constraints**: 
    - Each officer should receive 4 visits in total.
    - Each officer should receive 2 visits during the first 2 weeks.
    - Each agent group should visit one location in each of the 4 zones.
    - The total number of visits should be 140.
    - The visits should be evenly spaced among agents to avoid burnout.

4. **Objective Function**: 
    - This is a satisfaction problem. The goal is to find a feasible schedule that satisfies all the constraints.

5. **Potential Simplifications or Modeling Choices**: 
    - We can assume that the number of officers at each location is evenly distributed. For example, if a location hosts 4 officers, we can assume that each officer is visited once by each agent group.
    - We can also assume that the agents' workload is evenly distributed if each agent group visits one location in each zone every week.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the parameters
int: n_agents = 4; % number of agent groups
int: n_weeks = 4; % number of weeks
int: n_zones = 4; % number of zones
array[1..n_zones] of int: n_locations = [5, 5, 5, 4]; % number of locations in each zone
int: n_officers = 35; % number of officers
int: n_visits = 140; % total number of visits

% Define the decision variable
array[1..n_agents, 1..n_weeks, 1..n_zones, 1..max(n_locations)] of var 0..n_officers: visit;

% Each officer should receive 4 visits in total
constraint forall(o in 1..n_officers)(
  sum(a in 1..n_agents, w in 1..n_weeks, z in 1..n_zones, l in 1..n_locations)(visit[a,w,z,l] = o) = 4
);

% Each officer should receive 2 visits during the first 2 weeks
constraint forall(o in 1..n_officers)(
  sum(a in 1..n_agents, w in 1..2, z in 1..n_zones, l in 1..n_locations)(visit[a,w,z,l] = o) = 2
);

% Each agent group should visit one location in each of the 4 zones
constraint forall(a in 1..n_agents, w in 1..n_weeks)(
  sum(z in 1..n_zones)(sum(l in 1..n_locations[z])(visit[a,w,z,l] > 0)) = n_zones
);

% The total number of visits should be 140
constraint sum(a in 1..n_agents, w in 1..n_weeks, z in 1..n_zones, l in 1..n_locations)(visit[a,w,z,l] > 0) = n_visits;

% The visits should be evenly spaced among agents to avoid burnout
constraint forall(a in 1..n_agents)(
  sum(w in 1..n_weeks, z in 1..n_zones, l in 1..n_locations[z])(visit[a,w,z,l] > 0) = n_visits div n_agents
);

% Solve the problem
solve satisfy;
```

Note: This model assumes that each location hosts the same number of officers. If the number of officers at each location is different, the model needs to be adjusted accordingly.
