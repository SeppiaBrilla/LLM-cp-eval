**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Overview**: The problem involves scheduling 140 visits from 40 agents to 35 officers over 4 weeks. Each officer must receive exactly 4 visits, and each visit is performed by one agent to one officer on a specific week.

2. **Key Constraints Analysis**:
   - **Officer Visits**: Each officer must have exactly 4 visits. This is enforced by summing the binary decision variable over all agents and weeks for each officer.
   - **Early Visits**: Every officer must receive exactly 2 visits during the first 2 weeks. This is handled by summing visits for each officer over agents and weeks 1-2.
   - **Agent Workload**: The total visits are 140 with 40 agents, so the average visits per agent is 3.5. To balance workload, exactly 20 agents must have 3 visits and 20 agents must have 4 visits. This is enforced using counting constraints.
   - **Interim Report**: The first half of visits (70) must be completed after the first 2 weeks. Since each officer has 2 visits in the first 2 weeks, total visits in weeks 1-2 are 70, satisfying this automatically.
   - **Agent Zone Constraint**: The requirement that each agent visits one location in each of the 4 zones is considered but found mathematically impossible. With 40 agents and 140 visits, some agents must have only 3 visits, preventing them from covering all 4 zones. Thus, this constraint is omitted to ensure model feasibility.
   - **Zones and Locations**: The distribution of officers per location and zones is not needed for the core scheduling constraints, so it is not included in the model.

3. **Decision Variables**: A 3D binary variable `x[a, o, w]` is used to indicate whether agent `a` visits officer `o` on week `w`.

4. **Model Feasibility**: The model focuses on the feasible constraints related to officer visits, early visits, and agent workload. The omitted zone constraint does not affect the core scheduling problem.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Police Officer Visit Scheduling Model
% Parameters
int: A = 40; % Number of agents
int: O = 35; % Number of officers
int: W = 4;  % Number of weeks

% Decision variable: x[a, o, w] = 1 if agent a visits officer o on week w
array[1..A, 1..O, 1..W] of var bool: x;

% Constraint: Each officer has exactly 4 visits overall
constraint forall(o in 1..O) (
    sum(a in 1..A, w in 1..W) (x[a, o, w]) = 4
);

% Constraint: Each officer has exactly 2 visits in the first 2 weeks
constraint forall(o in 1..O) (
    sum(a in 1..A, w in 1..2) (x[a, o, w]) = 2
);

% Constraint: Each agent has either 3 or 4 visits
constraint forall(a in 1..A) (
    let { 
        var int: visits = sum(o in 1..O, w in 1..W) (x[a, o, w])
    } in
    visits == 3 \/ visits == 4
);

% Constraint: Exactly 20 agents have 3 visits and 20 have 4 visits
constraint count(a in 1..A) (
    sum(o in 1..O, w in 1..W) (x[a, o, w]) = 3
) = 20;

constraint count(a in 1..A) (
    sum(o in 1..O, w in 1..W) (x[a, o, w]) = 4
) = 20;

% Solve statement: satisfy all constraints
solve satisfy;

% Output: List all visits (agent, officer, week)
output [
    "Agent " ++ show(a) ++ " visits officer " ++ show(o) ++ " on week " ++ show(w) ++ "\n"
    | a in 1..A, o in 1..O, w in 1..W where x[a, o, w]
];
