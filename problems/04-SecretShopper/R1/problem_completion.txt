A well-known cosmetic company wants to evaluate the performance of their sales people, who are stationed at the companyâ€™s counters at various department stores in different geographical locations. For this purpose, the company has hired some secret agents to disguise themselves as shoppers to visit the sales people. The visits must be scheduled in such a way that each sales person must be visited by shoppers of different varieties and that the visits should be spaced out roughly evenly. Also, shoppers should visit sales people in different geographic locations. The exact constraints, which ensure the statistical soundness of the project, follow.
    There are a total of 19 outlets to be visited. They are located in 4 geographical regions: 5 outlets in Area 1 (outlet 1-5), 5 outlets in Area 2 (outlet 6-10), 5 outlets in Area 3 (outlet 11-15), and 4 outlets in Area 4 (outlet 16-19).
    There will be 1 to 4 sales people in each outlet. Each sales person will be visited by 4 different shoppers. The company has hired 20 secret shoppers. The visits will take place over 4 weeks. In each week, each sales person is visited by exactly one shopper. Over the 4 weeks, each sales person is visited by 4 different shoppers. Each shopper visits exactly 4 sales people over the 4 weeks, one per week. Furthermore, each shopper must visit sales people from at least 3 different geographic regions over the 4 weeks. No shopper visits more than one sales person from the same outlet.
