**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling visits by agents to locations across 4 zones over 4 weeks, with constraints on zone coverage and early visits per officer. However, there is a mathematical inconsistency: the number of visits per zone must equal the number of agents (35) due to each agent visiting one location per zone, but the officer distribution requires that the sum of officers per zone must be 8.75 to satisfy the visit count, which is not integer. Thus, the model is inherently infeasible for any integer officer distribution.

2. **Key Elements**:
   - Number of agents, A = 35 (derived from total visits 140 and 4 visits per agent).
   - Number of weeks, W = 4.
   - Zones: Zone 1 (locations 1-5), Zone 2 (locations 6-10), Zone 3 (locations 11-15), Zone 4 (locations 16-19).
   - Officers: Total 35, with O_l officers at location l. O_l must be provided as a parameter with 1 ≤ O_l ≤ 4 and sum O_l = 35.

3. **Decision Variables**:
   - `zone_assign[a, w]`: Zone visited by agent a in week w (1..4).
   - `location_assign[a, w]`: Location visited by agent a in week w (1..19).

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Zone Assignment**: For each agent, the zones visited over weeks must be a permutation of {1,2,3,4}.
   - **Location Assignment**: For each agent and week, the visited location must be in the assigned zone for that week.
   - **Early Visits**: For each location l, the number of visits in weeks 1-2 must be 2 * O_l, and in weeks 3-4 must be 2 * O_l.
   - **Zone Visit Count**: Inherent from agent assignment, but conflicts with early visit constraint due to mathematical inconsistency.

5. **Infeasibility**: The zone visit count constraint requires each zone to have exactly 35 visits, but the early visit constraint implies V_l = 4 * O_l for each location, leading to sum O_l per zone = 8.75, which is impossible for integer O_l. Thus, the model will be infeasible for any given O_l.

6. **Model Approach**: The MiniZinc code includes the above constraints, with O_l as parameters. The user must provide O_l values, but the model will not find a solution due to the inconsistency.

**MiniZinc model:**
```minizinc
% Parameters
int: A = 35; % Number of agents
int: W = 4; % Number of weeks
int: Z = 4; % Number of zones
int: L = 19; % Number of locations
array[1..L] of int: O; % Number of officers at each location, must be provided with sum(O) = 35 and 1 <= O[l] <= 4 for all l
% Zones: location l is in zone zone_of[l]
array[1..L] of int: zone_of = [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4];

% Decision variables
array[1..A, 1..W] of var 1..Z: zone_assign; % Zone visited by agent a in week w
array[1..A, 1..W] of var 1..L: location_assign; % Location visited by agent a in week w

% Constraints

% Each agent must visit all zones over the 4 weeks (permutation of zones)
constraint forall(a in 1..A) (
    all_different([zone_assign[a,w] | w in 1..W])
);

% Location must be in the assigned zone for that agent and week
constraint forall(a in 1..A, w in 1..W) (
    zone_of[location_assign[a,w]] == zone_assign[a,w]
);

% Compute V_l,w: number of visits to location l in week w
array[1..L, 1..W] of var int: V;
constraint forall(l in 1..L, w in 1..W) (
    V[l,w] = sum(a in 1..A) (bool2int(location_assign[a,w] == l))
);

% Early visit constraints: for each location, visits in weeks 1-2 must be 2*O_l, and in weeks 3-4 must be 2*O_l
constraint forall(l in 1..L) (
    sum([V[l,w] | w in 1..2]) == 2 * O[l]
);
constraint forall(l in 1..L) (
    sum([V[l,w] | w in 3..4]) == 2 * O[l]
);

% Note: The zone visit count constraint is inherent from agent assignment but conflicts with early visits.
% Specifically, for each zone z, sum_{l in z} V_l = A=35, but from early constraints, V_l = 4*O_l, so sum_{l in z} 4*O_l = 35, requiring sum O_l per zone = 8.75, which is impossible.
