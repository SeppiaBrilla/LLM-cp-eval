**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - We need to assign agents to locations and time periods
   - Each agent must visit exactly one location in each zone
   - We need to track which visits occur in weeks 1-2 vs weeks 3-4
   - We need to ensure officers get the right number of visits in each time period

2. **Key Parameters:**
   - 4 zones with locations: Zone 1 (1-5), Zone 2 (6-10), Zone 3 (11-15), Zone 4 (16-19)
   - 40 agents total (4 groups of 10)
   - 35 officers total across all locations (1-4 officers per location)
   - Each officer gets 4 visits total (2 in weeks 1-2, 2 in weeks 3-4)
   - Total visits = 140

3. **Decision Variables Needed:**
   - `visit[agent, location, period]`: binary variable indicating if agent visits location in time period
   - `officers[location]`: number of officers at each location (1-4)
   - We need to ensure agents visit exactly one location per zone per period

4. **Constraints:**
   - Each agent visits exactly one location in each zone over the 4 weeks
   - Each location's officers receive correct number of visits in each period
   - Total officers across all locations = 35
   - Officers at each location between 1-4
   - Each officer gets 2 visits in weeks 1-2 and 2 visits in weeks 3-4
   - Workload should be balanced among agents

5. **Modeling Approach:**
   - Use 2 time periods: period 1 (weeks 1-2) and period 2 (weeks 3-4)
   - Each agent must visit one location per zone per period
   - Track visits to ensure officer visit requirements are met

% Workload balancing: each agent should have similar total visits
% Each agent visits 4 locations total (1 per zone per period)
constraint forall(a in 1..num_agents)(
    sum(l in 1..total_locations, p in 1..num_periods)(visit[a,l,p]) = 4
