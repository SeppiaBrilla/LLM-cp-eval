Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The sequence of cars passing through the assembly line. This can be represented as an array of integers, where each integer represents a car and its index in the array represents its position in the sequence.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of each car in the sequence is the set of all possible cars to be produced.

3. Constraints:
   - Each station can handle at most a certain percentage of the cars passing along the assembly line. This can be represented as a constraint on the number of cars in any subsequence of the sequence that require a certain option.
   - The cars requiring a certain option must not be bunched together. This can be represented as a constraint that no two consecutive cars in the sequence require the same option.

4. Objective Function:
   - There is no objective function in this problem. The goal is to find a sequence of cars that satisfies the constraints, not to optimize any particular value.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - One possible simplification is to assume that each car requires exactly one option. This would simplify the constraints, as each car could be associated with exactly one station.
   - Another possible simplification is to assume that the capacity of each station is the same. This would simplify the constraints, as the same constraint could be applied to all stations.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the number of cars and the number of options
int: num_cars;
int: num_options;

% Define the capacity of each station as a percentage
array[1..num_options] of float: station_capacity;

% Define the sequence of cars as an array of integers
array[1..num_cars] of var 1..num_options: car_sequence;

% Define the option required by each car
array[1..num_cars] of var 1..num_options: car_option;

% Each station can handle at most a certain percentage of the cars
constraint forall(i in 1..num_options)(
  sum(j in 1..num_cars)(bool2int(car_option[j] = i)) <= ceil(station_capacity[i] * num_cars)
);

% The cars requiring a certain option must not be bunched together
constraint forall(i in 1..num_cars-1)(
  car_option[i] != car_option[i+1]
);

% Solve the problem
solve satisfy;
```

This model assumes that each car requires exactly one option and that the capacity of each station is given as a percentage of the total number of cars. The constraints ensure that each station can handle the required number of cars and that no two consecutive cars require the same option. The problem is solved by finding a sequence of cars that satisfies these constraints.
