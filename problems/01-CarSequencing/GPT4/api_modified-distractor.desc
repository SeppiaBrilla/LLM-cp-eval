Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The decision variables in this problem are the number of knapsacks that are assigned to each sewing station. These variables are integer variables.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of each decision variable is from 0 to the total number of knapsacks.

3. Constraints:
   - The first constraint is that the sum of the knapsacks assigned to each station must be equal to the total number of knapsacks.
   - The second constraint is that the number of knapsacks assigned to each station must not exceed the maximum capacity of that station.
   - The third constraint is that some accessories cannot go together. This can be modeled as a constraint that certain pairs of stations cannot both be assigned more than a certain number of knapsacks.

4. Objective Function:
   - The objective function is to maximize the total capacity of the knapsacks. This can be modeled as maximizing the sum of the capacities of the knapsacks assigned to each station.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - One simplification is to assume that the capacity of a knapsack is proportional to the number of accessories it has. This means that the capacity of a knapsack assigned to a station is equal to the number of accessories that station can sew.
   - Another simplification is to assume that the maximum capacity of a station is a fixed percentage of the total number of knapsacks. This means that the maximum number of knapsacks that can be assigned to a station is a fixed number.

MiniZinc model:
```minizinc
% Define the number of knapsacks and the number of stations
int: num_knapsacks;
int: num_stations;

% Define the maximum capacity of each station
array[1..num_stations] of int: max_capacity;

% Define the capacity of each knapsack when assigned to each station
array[1..num_stations, 1..num_knapsacks] of int: knapsack_capacity;

% Define the pairs of stations that cannot both be assigned more than a certain number of knapsacks
array[1..num_stations, 1..num_stations] of int: incompatible_pairs;

% Define the decision variables
array[1..num_stations] of var 0..num_knapsacks: knapsacks_assigned;

% The sum of the knapsacks assigned to each station must be equal to the total number of knapsacks
constraint sum(knapsacks_assigned) = num_knapsacks;

% The number of knapsacks assigned to each station must not exceed the maximum capacity of that station
constraint forall(i in 1..num_stations) (
  knapsacks_assigned[i] <= max_capacity[i]
);

% Certain pairs of stations cannot both be assigned more than a certain number of knapsacks
constraint forall(i in 1..num_stations, j in 1..num_stations) (
  if incompatible_pairs[i, j] > 0 then
    knapsacks_assigned[i] + knapsacks_assigned[j] <= incompatible_pairs[i, j]
  endif
);

% The objective is to maximize the total capacity of the knapsacks
var int: total_capacity = sum(i in 1..num_stations, j in 1..num_knapsacks) (
  knapsack_capacity[i, j] * knapsacks_assigned[i]
);
solve maximize total_capacity;

% Output the solution
output [ "Total capacity: ", show(total_capacity), "\n" ] ++
[ "Knapsacks assigned to station ", show(i), ": ", show(knapsacks_assigned[i]), "\n" | i in 1..num_stations ];
```
This model assumes that the capacity of a knapsack is proportional to the number of accessories it has, and that the maximum capacity of a station is a fixed percentage of the total number of knapsacks. It also assumes that the incompatibility between pairs of stations is symmetric, i.e., if station A cannot be assigned more than a certain number of knapsacks if station B is also assigned knapsacks, then the same restriction applies if the roles of A and B are reversed.
