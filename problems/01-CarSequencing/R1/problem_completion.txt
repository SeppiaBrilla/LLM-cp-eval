A number of cars are to be produced; they are not identical, because different options are available as variants on the basic model. The assembly line has different stations which install the various options (air-conditioning, sun-roof, etc.). These stations have been designed to handle at most a certain percentage of the cars passing along the assembly line. Furthermore, the cars requiring a certain option must not exceed the station's capacity within any consecutive sequence of cars, ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed to prevent overloading any station.
