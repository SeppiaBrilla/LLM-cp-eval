**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis:** The company produces a number of knapsacks, each of which can have various accessories attached. Each accessory has a dedicated sewing station with a capacity limit expressed as a maximum percentage of knapsacks that can have that accessory. Additionally, certain pairs of accessories are incompatible and cannot be placed on the same knapsack due to space constraints.

2. **Key Entities:**
   - **Knapsacks:** There are `N` knapsacks, each uniquely identified.
   - **Accessories:** There are `M` accessories, each with a percentage capacity `P[a]` (0-100) indicating the maximum proportion of knapsacks that can have it.
   - **Incompatible Pairs:** A list of pairs `(a,b)` where accessories `a` and `b` cannot be on the same knapsack.

3. **Decision Variables:** 
   - A binary matrix `x[i,j]` where `x[i,j] = 1` if knapsack `i` has accessory `j`, and `0` otherwise.

4. **Constraints:**
   - **Capacity Constraints:** For each accessory `j`, the total number of knapsacks with `j` must not exceed `floor(P[j] * N / 100)`. This is computed using integer division to handle discrete knapsacks.
   - **Incompatibility Constraints:** For each incompatible pair `(a,b)` and each knapsack `i`, `x[i,a]` and `x[i,b]` cannot both be 1. This is enforced by `x[i,a] + x[i,b] <= 1`.

5. **Problem Type:** This is a constraint satisfaction problem (no objective function), so we use `solve satisfy;` to find any feasible assignment.

6. **Modeling Considerations:**
   - The knapsack sizes are mentioned but do not affect the constraints, so they are ignored.
   - Percentages are handled with integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point issues.
   - Incompatible pairs are represented as a list of pairs for flexibility.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Parameters
int: N;                           % Number of knapsacks
int: M;                           % Number of accessories
array[1..M] of int: P;            % Percentage capacity for each accessory (0-100)
int: K;                           % Number of incompatible pairs
array[1..K, 1..2] of int: incompatible; % List of incompatible accessory pairs

% Decision variables: x[i,j] = 1 if knapsack i has accessory j
array[1..N, 1..M] of var 0..1: x;

% Constraints: Capacity for each accessory
constraint forall(j in 1..M) (
    sum(i in 1..N)(x[i,j]) <= (P[j] * N) div 100
);

% Constraints: Incompatible accessories cannot be on the same knapsack
constraint forall(k in 1..K) (
    forall(i in 1..N) (
        x[i, incompatible[k,1]] + x[i, incompatible[k,2]] <= 1
    )
);

% Solve for satisfaction
solve satisfy;

% Output the assignment matrix
output [ if j == 1 then "\n" else "" endif ++ 
         show(x[i,j]) ++ " " 
         | i in 1..N, j in 1..M ];
