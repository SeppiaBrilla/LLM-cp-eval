**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: This is the classic "Social Golfer Problem" - we need to schedule 32 golfers into groups of 4, maximizing the number of weeks while ensuring no two golfers play together more than once.

2. **Decision Variables**: 
   - We need variables to represent which golfers are in which groups in which weeks
   - Let's use a 3D array: `schedule[week, group, position]` where the value is the golfer ID
   - We have 32 golfers, so 8 groups per week (32 ÷ 4 = 8)
   - The maximum theoretical number of weeks is limited by the constraint that each pair can meet at most once

3. **Domain Analysis**:
   - Golfers are numbered 1 to 32
   - Groups per week: 8 groups (since 32 ÷ 4 = 8)
   - Maximum possible weeks: Each golfer can play with at most 3 others per week. Over multiple weeks, each golfer can play with at most 3×W different golfers (where W is number of weeks). Since there are 31 other golfers, we need 3×W ≥ 31, so W ≤ 10.33, meaning at most 10 weeks theoretically.
   - However, the actual maximum is often lower due to combinatorial constraints. For 32 golfers, the known maximum is 10 weeks.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Each golfer appears exactly once per week
   - Each group has exactly 4 golfers
   - No two golfers can be in the same group more than once across all weeks
   - All golfers in a group must be different

5. **Objective**: Maximize the number of weeks (this will be a parameter we can adjust to find the maximum feasible value)

6. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Use a 3D array for the schedule
   - Add symmetry breaking by fixing golfer 1 in group 1, position 1 for all weeks
   - Add lexicographic ordering constraints to reduce symmetry
