**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: This is a combinatorial design problem where we need to partition 32 scientists into teams of 4 each week, ensuring no pair of scientists appears together more than once across all weeks.

2. **Decision Variables**: 
   - We need binary variables to represent whether scientist i is in team j in week k
   - Alternatively, we can use variables to represent team assignments for each scientist in each week

3. **Key Constraints**:
   - Each week, scientists must be divided into exactly 8 teams of 4 (since 32/4 = 8)
   - Each scientist appears in exactly one team per week
   - No pair of scientists can be in the same team more than once across all weeks
   - We want to maximize the number of weeks

4. **Mathematical Insight**: This is related to a resolvable balanced incomplete block design (RBIBD). With 32 scientists in teams of 4, each scientist will meet 3 others each week. The maximum number of weeks is bounded by the fact that each scientist can meet at most 31 others, so theoretically we could have at most ⌊31/3⌋ = 10 weeks, but this may not be achievable due to the structure constraints.

5. **Modeling Approach**: 
   - Use a 3D binary array: `team[scientist, team_num, week]` indicating if scientist s is in team t in week w
   - Add constraints for team sizes, unique assignments, and pair restrictions
   - Maximize the number of active weeks

6. **Objective**: Maximize the number of weeks in the schedule

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Parameters
int: n_scientists = 32;
int: team_size = 4;
int: teams_per_week = n_scientists div team_size;  % 8 teams per week
int: max_weeks = 15;  % Upper bound estimate

% Decision variables
% team[s,t,w] = 1 if scientist s is in team t in week w
array[1..n_scientists, 1..teams_per_week, 1..max_weeks] of var 0..1: team;

% Number of active weeks (weeks that have at least one team formed)
array[1..max_weeks] of var 0..1: week_active;
var 0..max_weeks: num_weeks;

% Constraints

% Each scientist is in exactly one team per active week
constraint forall(w in 1..max_weeks, s in 1..n_scientists) (
    sum(t in 1..teams_per_week)(team[s,t,w]) = week_active[w]
);

% Each team in an active week has exactly team_size scientists
constraint forall(w in 1..max_weeks, t in 1..teams_per_week) (
    sum(s in 1..n_scientists)(team[s,t,w]) = team_size * week_active[w]
);

% No pair of scientists can be in the same team more than once
constraint forall(s1 in 1..n_scientists, s2 in s1+1..n_scientists) (
    sum(w in 1..max_weeks, t in 1..teams_per_week)(
        team[s1,t,w] * team[s2,t,w]
    ) <= 1
);

% Week ordering: if week w is not active, then week w+1 cannot be active
constraint forall(w in 1..max_weeks-1) (
    week_active[w+1] <= week_active[w]
);

% Count total number of weeks
constraint num_weeks = sum(w in 1..max_weeks)(week_active[w]);

% Objective: maximize number of weeks
solve maximize num_weeks;

% Output
output [
    "Number of weeks: \(num_weeks)\n"
] ++
[
    "Week \(w):\n" ++
    concat([
        "  Team \(t): " ++ 
        concat([show(s) ++ " " | s in 1..n_scientists where fix(team[s,t,w]) = 1]) ++ 
        "\n"
        | t in 1..teams_per_week where fix(week_active[w]) = 1
    ])
    | w in 1..max_weeks where fix(week_active[w]) = 1
];
