**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling 32 golfers into groups of 4 each week for as many weeks as possible, such that no two golfers play together in the same group more than once. This requires partitioning the golfers into 8 groups per week (since 32 / 4 = 8) and ensuring that over all weeks, each pair of golfers shares a group at most once.

2. **Key Constraints**:
   - **Weekly Group Formation**: Each week, all 32 golfers must be assigned to exactly 8 groups of 4 golfers each.
   - **Pairwise Uniqueness**: For any two distinct golfers, the number of weeks they are in the same group must be at most one.

3. **Modeling Choices**:
   - **Variables**: A 2D array `group[w, i]` is used, where `w` ranges over weeks and `i` ranges over golfers. Each variable represents the group number (1 to 8) that golfer `i` is assigned to in week `w`.
   - **Domains**: Each `group[w, i]` is an integer from 1 to 8 (since there are 8 groups per week).
   - **Constraints**:
     - **Cardinality Constraint**: For each week `w` and each group `g`, exactly 4 golfers must be assigned to group `g`. This ensures proper group sizes.
     - **Pairwise Constraint**: For every pair of golfers `i` and `j` (with `i < j`), the sum over all weeks of the Boolean condition `group[w, i] == group[w, j]` must be at most 1. This ensures that no pair plays together more than once.
   - **Symmetry Breaking**: To reduce symmetry, the group assignments for the first week are fixed in a canonical order: golfers 1-4 in group 1, 5-8 in group 2, ..., 29-32 in group 8. This helps the solver by eliminating equivalent solutions.

4. **Objective**: This is modeled as a satisfaction problem for a given number of weeks `W`. The goal is to find a feasible schedule for a specific `W`. To find the maximum `W`, one can solve the model for increasing values of `W` (starting from 1 up to the theoretical maximum of 10) until no solution is found.

5. **Theoretical Maximum**: Since each golfer has 31 others to avoid playing with more than once, and each week they play with 3 others, the maximum number of weeks is at most floor(31/3) = 10. Thus, `W=10` is the upper bound, but it may not be achievable due to combinatorial constraints.

**MiniZinc Model:**
```minizinc
% Social Golfer Problem for 32 golfers in groups of 4
% Parameters
int: N = 32; % Number of golfers
int: S = 4;  % Group size
int: G = N div S; % Number of groups per week (8)
int: W;      % Number of weeks (parameter to be specified)

% Decision variables: group assignment for each golfer each week
array[1..W, 1..N] of var 1..G: group;

% Constraints

% Each week, each group has exactly S golfers
constraint forall(w in 1..W) (
    forall(g in 1..G) (
        sum(i in 1..N) (group[w, i] == g) = S
    )
);

% No two golfers play together more than once
constraint forall(i, j in 1..N where i < j) (
    sum(w in 1..W) (group[w, i] == group[w, j]) <= 1
);

% Symmetry breaking: fix the first week's groups in canonical order
constraint forall(i in 1..N) (
    group[1, i] = ((i-1) div S) + 1
);

% Solve satisfy: find a feasible schedule for the given W
solve satisfy;

% Output the schedule in a readable format
output [
    "Schedule for " ++ show(W) ++ " weeks:\n"] ++
[ "Week " ++ show(w) ++ ": " ++ 
  show([if group[w, i] == g then show(i) else "" endif 
        | i in 1..N, g in 1..G]) 
  | w in 1..W
];
