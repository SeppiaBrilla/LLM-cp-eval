**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling weekly sessions for 32 scientists, divided into teams of 4 each week. The goal is to maximize the number of weeks (w) such that no two scientists are in the same team more than once. This is a classic Social Golfer Problem (SGP) with parameters: group size g=4, number of groups per round s=8 (since 32/4=8), and number of rounds w.

2. **Maximum Possible w**: The total number of unique scientist pairs is C(32,2) = 496. Each week, with 8 teams of 4, the number of pairs covered is 8 * C(4,2) = 48. Since no pair can be repeated, w must satisfy w * 48 ≤ 496, so w ≤ floor(496/48) = 10. Thus, the theoretical maximum w is 10.

3. **Decision Variables**: We define a 2D array `assign` where `assign[week, scientist]` represents the team number (1 to 8) for each scientist in each week. This allows us to model the team assignments directly.

4. **Domains**: Each element in `assign` is an integer from 1 to 8, representing the team assignments for 32 scientists over w weeks.

5. **Constraints**:
   - **Partition Constraint**: For each week and each team, exactly 4 scientists must be assigned to that team. This ensures valid team formations each week.
   - **Pairwise Constraint**: For every pair of distinct scientists, the number of weeks they are in the same team is at most 1. This ensures no repeated collaborations.

6. **Objective Handling**: Since MiniZinc requires fixed array sizes, w is treated as a parameter. The model checks feasibility for a given w. To maximize w, run the model for w=10, and if unsatisfiable, decrement w until a solution is found. The model itself is a satisfaction problem with no objective function; the objective is achieved externally by iterating over w.

7. **Symmetry Breaking**: No additional symmetry-breaking constraints are added here for simplicity, as the problem size is manageable, but they could be incorporated if needed for performance.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Parameters
int: w; % Number of weeks (to be set externally; try from 10 down to 1)
int: n = 32; % Number of scientists
int: g = 4; % Group size (scientists per team)
int: s = 8; % Number of teams per week (since n = g * s)

% Decision variables: assign[week, scientist] -> team number (1..s)
array[1..w, 1..n] of var 1..s: assign;

% Constraints

% Each week, each team has exactly g scientists
constraint forall(week in 1..w, team in 1..s) (
    count(i in 1..n)(assign[week, i] == team) == g
);

% No two scientists are in the same team more than once
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in i+1..n) (
    sum(week in 1..w)(assign[week, i] == assign[week, j]) <= 1
);

% Solve statement: satisfy the constraints (no objective since w is fixed)
solve satisfy;

% Output: Display the team assignments for each week
output [
    "Schedule for " ++ show(w) ++ " weeks:\n"] ++
    [ "Week " ++ show(week) ++ ": " ++ 
      show([assign[week, i] | i in 1..n]) ++ "\n"
      | week in 1..w
    ];
```

**Usage Notes:**
- Set `w` to the desired number of weeks (e.g., 10, 9, ...) when running the model.
- The model outputs a schedule if satisfiable, showing team assignments for each week.
- To maximize w, run the model sequentially for w=10,9,... until a solution is found. The first satisfiable w is the maximum.
