**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine which square zones to place in the park and where to place them. Each zone is characterized by its size (side length) and position.

2. **Problem Structure**: This is a square packing problem with additional constraints. We have a square park of some size N×N that needs to be completely filled with non-overlapping square zones of different integer sizes.

3. **Key Constraints**:
   - All zones must be squares with integer side lengths
   - All zones must have different sizes (distinct sizes)
   - Zones cannot overlap
   - Zones must be aligned with park boundaries
   - The entire park must be covered (no unused area)
   - No group of zones can form a rectangular block together

4. **Variables Needed**:
   - Park size N (parameter)
   - Set of zone sizes to use
   - Position coordinates for each zone
   - Binary variables to track which cells are occupied by which zones

5. **Modeling Approach**:
   - Use a grid-based approach where each cell (i,j) in the N×N park can be assigned to a zone
   - Each zone k has a size s[k] and top-left position (x[k], y[k])
   - The "no rectangular block" constraint is complex - it means no subset of zones can be arranged to form a rectangle when considered together

6. **Objective**: This appears to be a constraint satisfaction problem (complete coverage required) rather than optimization, though we could minimize the number of zones used.

**MiniZinc model:**

% Square Park Zone Design Problem
% Pack distinct square zones into a square park with no rectangular groupings

include "globals.mzn";

% Parameters
int: N; % Size of the square park (N x N)
int: max_zones = N; % Maximum number of zones we might need

% Decision variables
array[1..max_zones] of var 0..N: size;     % Size of each zone (0 means zone not used)
array[1..max_zones] of var 1..N: x;       % X coordinate of top-left corner
array[1..max_zones] of var 1..N: y;       % Y coordinate of top-left corner
array[1..max_zones] of var bool: used;    % Whether zone is used

% Grid to track which zone occupies each cell
array[1..N, 1..N] of var 1..max_zones: grid;

% Constraint: Link used zones with their sizes
constraint forall(k in 1..max_zones)(
    used[k] <-> size[k] > 0
);

% Constraint: All used zones must have distinct sizes
constraint forall(i, j in 1..max_zones where i < j)(
    used[i] /\ used[j] -> size[i] != size[j]
);

% Constraint: Zones must fit within park boundaries
constraint forall(k in 1..max_zones)(

% Constraint: Each cell belongs to exactly one zone

        y[k] <= j /\ j <= y[k] + size[k] - 1 /\
        grid[i,j] = k
    )

% Constraint: Grid assignment consistency
constraint forall(i, j in 1..N, k in 1..max_zones)(
    grid[i,j] = k -> (

        y[k] <= j /\ j <= y[k] + size[k] - 1
    )

% Constraint: No rectangular blocks formed by multiple zones
% This prevents any rectangular region from being formed by 2 or more zones

        set of int: zones_in_rect = {grid[i,j] | i in r1..r2, j in c1..c2}
    } in
    % If the rectangle contains cells from multiple zones, 
    % then it cannot form a perfect rectangle (must have "gaps" or irregular boundaries)
    card(zones_in_rect) > 1 -> 
        exists(i in r1..r2, j in c1..c2)(
            % At least one cell in the rectangle must be adjacent to a cell from a different zone
            % or be at the boundary of its zone within this rectangle
            exists(di, dj in {-1, 0, 1} where abs(di) + abs(dj) = 1)(
                let {
                    int: ni = i + di,
                    int: nj = j + dj
                } in
                (ni >= r1 /\ ni <= r2 /\ nj >= c1 /\ nj <= c2) ->
                grid[i,j] != grid[ni,nj]
            )

% Objective: Minimize number of zones (optional)
var int: num_zones = sum(k in 1..max_zones)(used[k]);
