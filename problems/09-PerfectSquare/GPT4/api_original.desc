Reasoning:

1. **Decision Variables**: The decision variables in this problem are the coordinates (x, y) of the bottom-left corner of each square and the size of the packing square. The coordinates will determine the placement of each square within the packing square, and the size of the packing square will determine the total area that we have to fill.

2. **Domains**: The domain of the coordinates (x, y) is from 0 to the size of the packing square. The domain of the size of the packing square is from the size of the largest square to the sum of the areas of all squares.

3. **Constraints**: The constraints for this problem are:
   - Each square must be within the packing square. This means that for each square, x + size <= packing square size and y + size <= packing square size.
   - No two squares can overlap. This means that for any two squares i and j, either i's right edge is to the left of j's left edge, i's left edge is to the right of j's right edge, i's top edge is below j's bottom edge, or i's bottom edge is above j's top edge.
   - All squares must be used, and the total area of the squares must equal the area of the packing square.
   - All squares have different sizes.

4. **Objective Function**: This is a satisfaction problem, so there is no objective function. We are simply trying to find a valid placement of the squares that satisfies all the constraints.

5. **Modeling Choices**: One potential simplification is to assume that the squares are sorted in non-increasing order of size. This can make it easier to find a valid placement, as we can start by placing the largest squares and then fill in the smaller squares around them.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the number of squares and their sizes
int: n; % number of squares
array[1..n] of int: sizes; % sizes of the squares

% Define the decision variables
array[1..n] of var 0..sum(sizes): x; % x-coordinates of the squares
array[1..n] of var 0..sum(sizes): y; % y-coordinates of the squares
var max(sizes)..sum(sizes): packing_size; % size of the packing square

% Each square must be within the packing square
constraint forall(i in 1..n) (
  x[i] + sizes[i] <= packing_size /\ y[i] + sizes[i] <= packing_size
);

% No two squares can overlap
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in i+1..n) (
  x[i] + sizes[i] <= x[j] \/ x[j] + sizes[j] <= x[i] \/
  y[i] + sizes[i] <= y[j] \/ y[j] + sizes[j] <= y[i]
);

% The total area of the squares must equal the area of the packing square
constraint sum(i in 1..n) (sizes[i]*sizes[i]) = packing_size*packing_size;

% All squares have different sizes
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in i+1..n) (
  sizes[i] != sizes[j]
);

% Solve the problem
