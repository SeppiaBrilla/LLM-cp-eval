Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The side length of the park, which is a single integer.
   - The side lengths of the zones, which are a set of integers.

2. Domains:
   - The side length of the park is a positive integer.
   - The side lengths of the zones are positive integers less than or equal to the side length of the park.

3. Constraints:
   - The sum of the squares of the side lengths of the zones must be equal to the square of the side length of the park. This ensures that the zones fill the entire park without overlapping.
   - All zone side lengths must be distinct. This ensures that every zone is a different size.
   - No group of zones larger than one may be arranged together to form a rectangular block. This can be ensured by making sure that no two zones have side lengths that are multiples of each other.

4. This is a satisfaction problem, as we are not trying to optimize any objective function.

5. Potential Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - We can assume that the side length of the park is a fixed value, as it is not specified in the problem description. This simplifies the problem by reducing the number of decision variables.
   - We can also assume that the number of zones is fixed, as it is not specified in the problem description. This also simplifies the problem by reducing the number of decision variables.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the side length of the park
int: park_side_length = 10;

% Define the number of zones
int: num_zones = 4;

% Define the side lengths of the zones
array[1..num_zones] of var 1..park_side_length: zone_side_lengths;

% The sum of the squares of the zone side lengths must be equal to the square of the park side length
constraint sum([zone_side_lengths[i]*zone_side_lengths[i] | i in 1..num_zones]) = park_side_length*park_side_length;

% All zone side lengths must be distinct
constraint alldifferent(zone_side_lengths);

% No group of zones larger than one may be arranged together to form a rectangular block
constraint forall(i in 1..num_zones, j in i+1..num_zones) (
  zone_side_lengths[i] mod zone_side_lengths[j] != 0 /\ zone_side_lengths[j] mod zone_side_lengths[i] != 0
);

% Solve the problem
solve satisfy;
```

This model will find a set of zone side lengths that satisfy the constraints of the problem. If no such set exists, it will return unsatisfiable.
