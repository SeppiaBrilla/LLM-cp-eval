**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves packing a set of squares with distinct integer sizes into a larger square without overlapping, with all squares aligned to the big square's axes. The placement must be perfect, meaning the sum of the areas of the small squares equals the area of the big square. Additionally, for simplicity, no subset of two or more squares should form a rectangle within the big square, meaning no smaller rectangle is exactly covered by multiple small squares.

2. **Variables**:
   - `n`: Number of small squares.
   - `s`: Array of sizes of the small squares, `s[1..n]`, all distinct integers.
   - `L`: Side length of the big square, determined by the constraint `L*L = sum(s[i]^2 for i in 1..n)`. Since `s[i]` are integers, `L` must be an integer, so we define it as a variable and constrain it.
   - `x` and `y`: Arrays for the coordinates of the bottom-left corners of the small squares, `x[1..n]` and `y[1..n]`, with domains from `0` to `L - s[i]` for each `i`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Area Constraint**: `L*L = sum(i in 1..n) (s[i] * s[i])` ensures the big square's area matches the total area of small squares.
   - **Within Bounds**: For each square `i`, `0 <= x[i] <= L - s[i]` and `0 <= y[i] <= L - s[i]` ensure it fits inside the big square.
   - **No Overlap**: For all pairs `i, j` where `i < j`, the constraint `(x[i] + s[i] <= x[j]) \/ (x[j] + s[j] <= x[i]) \/ (y[i] + s[i] <= y[j]) \/ (y[j] + s[j] <= y[i])` ensures no two squares overlap.
   - **Simple Condition**: This requires that no subset of two or more squares exactly covers a rectangle within the big square. Modeling this directly involves checking all possible rectangles defined by critical points (e.g., all combinations of x and y coordinates), which is computationally expensive (O(n^4) or O(L^4)) and not feasible for non-trivial instances. Therefore, this constraint is omitted in the code below for practicality. If needed, it could be added by iterating over all possible rectangles and ensuring that for each, the sum of areas of squares completely inside it does not equal the rectangle's area when the number of squares is greater than 1.

4. **Modeling Choices**:
   - `L` is defined as a variable but is constrained to be the integer square root of the sum of squares, which must be exact.
   - The no-overlap constraint uses disjunctive conditions for clarity and efficiency.
   - Domains for `x[i]` and `y[i]` are set to `0..L - s[i]` to ensure bounds.
   - The simple condition is not implemented due to its complexity, but the model can be extended if critical points are handled.

**MiniZinc model:**
```minizinc
% Perfect Square Placement Problem (without simple condition)
% Given a set of squares with distinct sizes, pack them into a big square without overlap.
% The sum of areas of small squares equals the area of the big square.

int: n; % number of small squares
array[1..n] of int: s; % sizes of small squares, all distinct integers

% Big square side L, constrained by the total area
var int: L;
constraint L*L = sum(i in 1..n) (s[i] * s[i]);

% Coordinates for bottom-left corners of small squares
array[1..n] of var int: x;
array[1..n] of var int: y;

% Each square must be within the big square
constraint forall(i in 1..n) (
    x[i] >= 0 /\ x[i] <= L - s[i] /\
    y[i] >= 0 /\ y[i] <= L - s[i]
);

% No overlap between any two squares
constraint forall(i, j in 1..n where i < j) (
    (x[i] + s[i] <= x[j]) \/ 
    (x[j] + s[j] <= x[i]) \/ 
    (y[i] + s[i] <= y[j]) \/ 
    (y[j] + s[j] <= y[i])
);

% Note: The simple condition (no subset of squares placed in a rectangle) is not implemented here due to computational complexity.
% To add it, one would need to check all possible rectangles within the big square and ensure that if a rectangle is exactly covered by squares, then only one square is involved.
% This requires iterating over O(L^4) rectangles, which is expensive for large L.
