**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves dividing a square park of side length \( S \) into smaller square zones of distinct integer side lengths. The zones must be aligned with the park's boundaries, non-overlapping, and cover the entire park. Additionally, no group of two or more zones should form a larger rectangle when combined.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The park is a square of size \( S \times S \), where \( S \) is an integer parameter.
   - The number of zones \( M \) is a parameter, representing the number of squares used in the dissection. \( M \) must be chosen such that the sum of the squares of the side lengths equals \( S^2 \), and all side lengths are distinct.
   - Each zone is a square defined by its lower-left corner coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) and side length \( l_i \), where \( x_i, y_i, l_i \) are integers between 1 and \( S \).

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Distinct Sizes**: All \( l_i \) must be distinct, enforced using `alldifferent`.
   - **Area Coverage**: The sum of the areas of all zones must equal \( S^2 \).
   - **Within Park**: Each zone must fit entirely within the park, so \( x_i + l_i - 1 \leq S \) and \( y_i + l_i - 1 \leq S \).
   - **No Overlap**: For any two zones, they must not overlap. This is enforced by ensuring that for each pair, one zone is entirely to the left, right, above, or below the other.
   - **Full Coverage**: Every unit cell in the park must be covered by exactly one zone, enforced by requiring that for each cell \((a,b)\), there exists a zone that covers it.
   - **No Rectangle Subset**: For any rectangle \( R \) in the park with area at least 2, if two or more zones intersect \( R \), then at least one of them must not be completely within \( R \). This ensures that no subset of zones forms a larger rectangle.

4. **Modeling Choices**:
   - \( S \) and \( M \) are parameters to allow flexibility. For small \( S \), \( M \) can be set based on the maximum possible number of distinct squares that can sum to \( S^2 \).
   - The no-rectangle-subset constraint is implemented by iterating over all possible rectangles \( R \) with area â‰¥ 2 and checking the conditions on intersecting zones.
   - The model uses decision variables for the positions and sizes of zones, with constraints to ensure the dissection meets all requirements.

5. **Complexity Considerations**:
   - The number of rectangles \( R \) is \( O(S^4) \), which may be computationally intensive for large \( S \). However, for small \( S \) (e.g., \( S \leq 10 \)), it is feasible.
   - The covering constraint involves \( O(S^2) \) checks, each with \( O(M) \) conditions, which is manageable for small \( S \) and \( M \).
