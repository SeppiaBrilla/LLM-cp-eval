**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Understanding**: A Golomb ruler with m marks is defined by a set of integers where the first mark is 0, marks are strictly increasing, and all pairwise differences between marks are distinct. The goal is to find such a set that minimizes the last mark (the length). Symmetry can be broken by constraining that the first difference (a2 - a1) is less than the last difference (am - am-1).

2. **Variables**:
   - We need an array `marks` of size m, where each mark is a non-negative integer.
   - The first mark `marks[1]` is fixed to 0.
   - The domain for marks should be bounded to ensure finite search. A reasonable upper bound `max_length` is set to `m * m` based on known Golomb ruler lengths for small m, but this can be adjusted if needed.

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Strictly Increasing**: Marks must be in strictly increasing order: `marks[i] < marks[i+1]` for all i from 1 to m-1.
   - **Distinct Differences**: All differences `marks[j] - marks[i]` for i < j must be distinct. This is enforced by collecting all differences into an array and applying `alldifferent`.
   - **Symmetry Breaking**: To break symmetry, add `marks[2] < marks[m] - marks[m-1]` (since a1=0, the first difference is `marks[2]`, and the last difference is `marks[m] - marks[m-1]`).

4. **Objective**: Minimize `marks[m]`, the length of the ruler.

5. **Modeling Choices**:
   - The number of differences is `n_diffs = m * (m-1) // 2`.
   - Differences are computed using a list comprehension for all i < j.
   - The model uses parameters for flexibility: `m` (number of marks) and `max_length` (upper bound, with default `m * m`).

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Golomb Ruler Model
% Parameters: m (number of marks), max_length (upper bound for marks, default m*m)
int: m;
int: max_length = m * m; % Default upper bound, can be overridden

% Decision variables: marks[1] = 0, marks[i] for i=2..m are in 0..max_length
array[1..m] of var 0..max_length: marks;

% Number of pairwise differences
int: n_diffs = (m * (m-1)) div 2;

% Array of all differences marks[j] - marks[i] for i < j
array[1..n_diffs] of var int: diffs = [ marks[j] - marks[i] | i in 1..m, j in i+1..m ];

% Constraints
constraint marks[1] == 0; % First mark is 0
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1)(marks[i] < marks[i+1]); % Strictly increasing
constraint alldifferent(diffs); % All differences are distinct
constraint marks[2] < marks[m] - marks[m-1]; % Symmetry breaking: first difference < last difference

% Objective: minimize the length (last mark)
solve minimize marks[m];

% Output the ruler
output ["Golomb ruler with ", show(m), " marks: ", show(marks), "\nLength: ", show(marks[m])];
```

This model defines a Golomb ruler problem with parameters for flexibility and includes all necessary constraints and the optimization objective. The output displays the marks and the minimized length.
