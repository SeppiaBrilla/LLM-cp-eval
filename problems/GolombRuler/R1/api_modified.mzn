### Reasoning

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves placing `m` beacons on a straight path with the first beacon fixed at position 0. The key requirement is that all pairwise distances between beacons must be unique. This is equivalent to the Golomb ruler problem, where we seek a set of marks (beacon positions) such that all differences between pairs are distinct.

2. **Decision Variables**: 
   - Let `x` be an array of size `m` representing the positions of the beacons. `x[1]` is fixed at 0.
   - For `i` from 2 to `m`, `x[i]` is a positive integer variable with `x[i] > x[i-1]` to ensure positions are strictly increasing.

3. **Domains**: 
   - `x[1]` is fixed to 0.
   - `x[i]` for `i > 1` are integer variables with lower bound 1 (implied by ordering) and no explicit upper bound initially, but the solver will handle minimization. For practicality, an upper bound could be set based on known Golomb ruler lengths, but it is omitted here for generality.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Ordering**: The positions must be strictly increasing: `x[i] < x[i+1]` for all `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
   - **Unique Differences**: All pairwise differences `x[i] - x[j]` for `i > j` must be distinct. The number of such differences is `N = m*(m-1)/2`. An array `diffs` is created containing all these differences, and the `alldifferent` constraint is applied to it.

5. **Objective Function**: The goal is to minimize the total path length, which is the position of the last beacon `x[m]`. This is an optimization problem, so we use `minimize x[m]`.

6. **Modeling Considerations**: 
   - The model uses integer variables and leverages MiniZinc's `alldifferent` constraint for simplicity.
   - The differences are generated using a comprehension over all pairs `(i,j)` with `i > j`.
   - No symmetry-breaking constraints are added, as the fixed first position and strict ordering naturally reduce symmetry.

### MiniZinc Model

```minizinc
% Golomb Ruler Model for Beacon Placement
% Parameters: m - number of beacons
int: m;

% Decision variables: positions of beacons, x[1] = 0, others positive integers
array[1..m] of var int: x;

% Constraint: first beacon at position 0
constraint x[1] = 0;

% Constraint: positions are strictly increasing
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1)(x[i] < x[i+1]);

% Number of pairwise differences
int: N = m * (m-1) div 2;

% Array of all pairwise differences for i > j
array[1..N] of var int: diffs = [ x[i] - x[j] | i in 2..m, j in 1..i-1 ];

% Constraint: all pairwise differences must be unique
constraint alldifferent(diffs);

% Objective: minimize the position of the last beacon
solve minimize x[m];

% Output: display the positions
output ["Beacon positions: ", show(x), "\n"];
