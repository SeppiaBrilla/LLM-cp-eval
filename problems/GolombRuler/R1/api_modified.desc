**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis:** The problem requires placing `m` beacons on a straight path starting at position 0, with all pairwise distances between beacons being unique. The goal is to minimize the position of the last beacon to reduce cost, which aligns with the Golomb ruler problem.

2. **Key Elements:**
   - The first beacon is fixed at position 0.
   - Positions must be strictly increasing to avoid duplicate distances (since distances are positive and distinct).
   - All pairwise distances must be unique, meaning no two pairs of beacons share the same distance.

3. **Mathematical Model:**
   - **Decision Variables:** Let `pos[i]` be the position of the `i-th` beacon for `i = 1..m`, with `pos[1] = 0`.
   - **Domains:** `pos[i]` are integers, with `pos[i]` for `i > 1` ranging from 1 to an upper bound (set to `m * m` for simplicity, as the optimal length for small `m` is bounded by this).
   - **Constraints:**
     - Strictly increasing positions: `pos[i] < pos[i+1]` for `i = 1..m-1`.
     - All pairwise distances are distinct: the set `{ pos[j] - pos[i] | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m }` must have no duplicates.
   - **Objective:** Minimize `pos[m]`, the position of the last beacon.

4. **MiniZinc Implementation:**
   - Use a parameter `m` for the number of beacons.
   - Compute the number of pairs `n_pairs = m * (m-1) div 2`.
   - Define an array `pos` of integer variables with `pos[1] = 0` and domains up to `m * m`.
   - Enforce strictly increasing positions with inequality constraints.
   - Compute all pairwise distances into an array `dists` and apply `all_different` constraint.
   - Minimize `pos[m]`.

5. **Optimization Notes:**
   - The upper bound `m * m` is chosen heuristically for small `m`; it can be adjusted if needed for larger instances.
   - The model uses integer arithmetic and combinatorial constraints, which are suitable for small to moderate `m`.

**MiniZinc Model:**
```minizinc
% Parameter: number of beacons
int: m;

% Derived parameter: number of pairwise distances
int: n_pairs = (m * (m - 1)) div 2;

% Decision variables: positions of beacons, with first at 0
array[1..m] of var 0..m*m: pos;

% Constraint: first beacon at position 0
constraint pos[1] = 0;

% Constraint: positions are strictly increasing
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1) (pos[i] < pos[i+1]);

% Compute all pairwise distances
array[1..n_pairs] of var int: dists = [pos[j] - pos[i] | i in 1..m, j in i+1..m];

% Constraint: all pairwise distances must be unique
constraint all_different(dists);

% Objective: minimize the position of the last beacon
solve minimize pos[m];

% Output: show the positions and distances (optional)
output ["Positions: ", show(pos), "\nDistances: ", show(dists)];
