Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The decision variables are the positions of the marks on the ruler, represented as an array `a` of size `m`. Each element `a[i]` represents the position of the `i`th mark on the ruler.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of each `a[i]` is from `0` to `m*(m-1)/2`, as the maximum possible length of the ruler is `m*(m-1)/2`.

3. Constraints:
   - The first mark is at position `0`, i.e., `a[1] = 0`.
   - The marks are in increasing order, i.e., `a[i] < a[j]` for all `1 <= i < j <= m`.
   - All differences `a[j] - a[i]` are distinct for all `1 <= i < j <= m`. This can be represented as a boolean matrix `diff`, where `diff[i,j]` is `true` if `a[j] - a[i]` is a valid difference, and `false` otherwise. The constraint is that all `diff[i,j]` are `true`.
   - The first difference is less than the last, i.e., `a[2] - a[1] < a[m] - a[m-1]`.

4. Objective Function:
   - The objective is to minimize the length of the ruler, which is `a[m]`.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - The problem can be simplified by removing the symmetry, i.e., by adding the constraint that the first difference is less than the last.
   - The problem can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem with an objective function.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Number of marks
int: m;

% Positions of the marks
array[1..m] of var 0..m*(m-1)/2: a;

% Differences between the marks
array[1..m, 1..m] of var bool: diff;

% The first mark is at position 0
constraint a[1] = 0;

% The marks are in increasing order
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1) (
  a[i] < a[i+1]
);

% All differences are distinct
constraint forall(i in 1..m, j in i+1..m) (
  diff[i,j] = (forall(k in 1..m, l in k+1..m) (
    if i != k \/ j != l then
      a[j] - a[i] != a[l] - a[k]
    else
      true
    endif
  ))
);

% The first difference is less than the last
constraint a[2] - a[1] < a[m] - a[m-1];

% Minimize the length of the ruler
solve minimize a[m];

% Output the positions of the marks
output [ show(a[i]) ++ " " | i in 1..m ];
```

This model finds the positions of the marks on a Golomb ruler with `m` marks that minimizes the length of the ruler. The positions are output in increasing order.
