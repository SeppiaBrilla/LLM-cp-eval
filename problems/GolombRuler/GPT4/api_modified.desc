Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The decision variables are the positions of the beacons along the path. We can represent these positions as an array of integers, `beacons[1..m]`, where `beacons[i]` is the position of the `i-th` beacon.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of each `beacons[i]` is from `0` to `sum(1..m-1)`. The lower bound is `0` because the first beacon is always at position `0`. The upper bound is `sum(1..m-1)` because in the worst case, the `i-th` beacon could be at the position that is the sum of the positions of all previous beacons.

3. Constraints:
   - The first beacon is always at position `0`, so `beacons[1] = 0`.
   - All pairs of beacons should have a unique distance. This can be represented as `forall(i in 1..m, j in i+1..m)(beacons[j] - beacons[i] != beacons[k] - beacons[l])` for all `k` in `1..m`, `l` in `k+1..m` where `(i, j) != (k, l)`.
   - The beacons should be in increasing order of their positions, so `beacons[i] < beacons[i+1]` for all `i` in `1..m-1`.

4. Objective Function:
   - The objective is to minimize the position of the last beacon, which is `beacons[m]`.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - Instead of checking the uniqueness of the distances between all pairs of beacons, we can just ensure that the distances between consecutive beacons are unique. This is because if the distances between consecutive beacons are unique, then the distances between all pairs of beacons will also be unique. This can be represented as `forall(i in 1..m-1)(beacons[i+1] - beacons[i] != beacons[j+1] - beacons[j])` for all `j` in `1..i-1`.

MiniZinc model:
```minizinc
include "globals.mzn";

% number of beacons
int: m;

% positions of the beacons
array[1..m] of var 0..sum(i in 1..m-1)(i): beacons;

% the first beacon is always at position 0
constraint beacons[1] = 0;

% the beacons should be in increasing order of their positions
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1)(beacons[i] < beacons[i+1]);

% the distances between consecutive beacons are unique
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1, j in 1..i-1)(beacons[i+1] - beacons[i] != beacons[j+1] - beacons[j]);

% minimize the position of the last beacon
solve minimize beacons[m];

output ["Beacon positions: " ++ show(beacons)];
