Reasoning:
1. The decision variables are the positions of the marks on the ruler, represented as an array `a` of size `m`. The domain of each variable is the set of integers from 0 to `m*(m-1)/2`, which is the maximum possible length of the ruler.
2. The first mark is always at position 0, so `a[1]` is fixed at 0.
3. The marks must be in increasing order, so for each `i` from 2 to `m`, `a[i] > a[i-1]`.
4. The differences between all pairs of marks must be distinct. This can be represented as an array `diff` of size `m*(m-1)/2`, where `diff[k]` is the difference between the `i`-th and `j`-th mark for some `i` and `j`. The domain of each `diff` variable is the set of integers from 1 to `m*(m-1)/2`.
5. The first difference `a[2] - a[1]` must be less than the last difference `a[m] - a[m-1]`.
6. The objective is to minimize the length of the ruler, which is `a[m]`.
7. This is an optimization problem.

MiniZinc model:
```minizinc
% Number of marks
int: m;

% Positions of the marks
array[1..m] of var 0..m*(m-1)/2: a;

% Differences between all pairs of marks
array[1..m*(m-1)/2] of var 1..m*(m-1)/2: diff;

% The first mark is at position 0
constraint a[1] = 0;

% The marks are in increasing order
constraint forall(i in 2..m) (a[i] > a[i-1]);

% The differences are distinct
constraint alldifferent(diff);

% The differences are correct
constraint forall(i in 1..m, j in i+1..m) (diff[(i-1)*(m-i/2)+j-i] = a[j] - a[i]);

% The first difference is less than the last
constraint a[2] - a[1] < a[m] - a[m-1];

% Minimize the length of the ruler
solve minimize a[m];
```
This model assumes that the number of marks `m` is given as input. The positions of the marks and the differences between them are decision variables. The constraints ensure that the marks are in increasing order, the differences are distinct and correct, and the first difference is less than the last. The objective is to minimize the length of the ruler.
