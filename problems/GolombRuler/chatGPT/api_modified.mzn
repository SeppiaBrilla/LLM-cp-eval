Reasoning:

1. The decision variables are the positions of the beacons along the path. These are integer variables, and their domain is 0..m-1, where m is the number of beacons.

2. The first constraint is that the first beacon is always at position 0.

3. The second constraint is that all pairs of beacons should have a unique distance. This can be encoded by creating a boolean matrix where each cell represents whether a certain distance is used or not. Then, for each pair of beacons, we set the corresponding cell in the matrix to true. Finally, we add a constraint that all cells in the matrix must be different.

4. The objective function is to minimize the position of the last beacon, which corresponds to the total design length. This is an optimization problem.

5. A potential simplification is to sort the beacon positions in ascending order. This way, we can ensure that the distances between consecutive beacons are always unique, and we don't need to check all pairs of beacons.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Number of beacons
int: m;

% Beacon positions
array[1..m] of var 0..m-1: beacon_positions;

% First beacon is always at position 0
constraint beacon_positions[1] = 0;

% All beacon positions are sorted in ascending order
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1) (
  beacon_positions[i] <= beacon_positions[i+1]
);

% All pairs of beacons have a unique distance
constraint forall(i in 1..m, j in i+1..m) (
  let {
    int: distance = beacon_positions[j] - beacon_positions[i];
  } in
  forall(k in 1..m, l in k+1..m) (
    if i != k \/ j != l then
      distance != beacon_positions[l] - beacon_positions[k]
    else
      true
  )
);

% Minimize the position of the last beacon
solve minimize beacon_positions[m];
```

This model assumes that the number of beacons m is given as input. The beacon_positions array represents the positions of the beacons along the path. The constraints ensure that the first beacon is at position 0, the beacon positions are sorted in ascending order, and all pairs of beacons have a unique distance. The objective is to minimize the position of the last beacon, which corresponds to the total design length.
