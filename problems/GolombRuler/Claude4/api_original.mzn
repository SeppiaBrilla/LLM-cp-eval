**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need m variables representing the positions of marks on the ruler: a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ where a₁ = 0 and a₁ < a₂ < ... < aₘ.

2. **Domains**: Since a₁ = 0 is fixed, we need variables a₂, ..., aₘ. The upper bound for aₘ (ruler length) is not known a priori, but we can use a reasonable upper bound or make it a parameter to minimize.

3. **Core Constraints**:
   - Ordering: 0 = a₁ < a₂ < ... < aₘ
   - Distinctness: All differences aⱼ - aᵢ (where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m) must be distinct
   - Symmetry breaking: a₂ - a₁ < aₘ - aₘ₋₁ (equivalently: a₂ < aₘ - aₘ₋₁)

4. **Objective**: This is an optimization problem - minimize the length of the ruler (aₘ).

5. **Modeling choices**: 
   - We can represent the differences explicitly as auxiliary variables to make the distinctness constraint clearer
   - We need to calculate how many differences there are: m(m-1)/2
   - We need a reasonable upper bound for the ruler length - this can be estimated or made large enough

6. **Implementation details**:
   - Use array indexing starting from 1 for marks a[1..m] where a[1] = 0
   - Create an array for all differences
   - Use alldifferent constraint on the differences array

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Golomb Ruler Problem
% Find m marks on a ruler such that all pairwise differences are distinct
% and the ruler length is minimized

% Parameters
int: m;  % number of marks
int: max_length = m * m;  % upper bound estimate for ruler length

% Decision variables
array[1..m] of var 0..max_length: marks;

% Fix first mark at position 0
constraint marks[1] = 0;

% Ordering constraint: marks must be in strictly increasing order
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1) (
    marks[i] < marks[i+1]
);

% Calculate all pairwise differences
int: num_diffs = m * (m - 1) div 2;
array[1..num_diffs] of var 1..max_length: differences;

% Map differences to the difference array
constraint
    let {
        array[1..num_diffs] of int: diff_indices = 
            [i * m + j - (i * (i + 1)) div 2 | i in 1..m-1, j in i+1..m]
    } in
    forall(k in 1..num_diffs) (
        let {
            int: i = min([i | i in 1..m-1, j in i+1..m 
                         where i * m + j - (i * (i + 1)) div 2 = k]),
            int: j = min([j | i in 1..m-1, j in i+1..m 
                         where i * m + j - (i * (i + 1)) div 2 = k])
        } in
        differences[k] = marks[j] - marks[i]
    );

% All differences must be distinct
constraint alldifferent(differences);

% Symmetry breaking constraint: first difference < last difference
constraint marks[2] - marks[1] < marks[m] - marks[m-1];

% Objective: minimize ruler length
solve minimize marks[m];

% Output
output [
    "Marks: " ++ show(marks) ++ "\n" ++
    "Length: " ++ show(marks[m]) ++ "\n" ++
    "Differences: " ++ show(differences) ++ "\n"
];
