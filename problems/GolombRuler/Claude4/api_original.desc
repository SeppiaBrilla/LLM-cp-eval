**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to represent the m marks on the Golomb ruler. Let's use an array `marks` of size m, where `marks[i]` represents the position of the i-th mark (a_i in the problem description).

2. **Domains**: 
   - The first mark is fixed at 0: `marks[1] = 0`
   - The other marks are positive integers with an upper bound. Since we want to minimize length, we need a reasonable upper bound. A loose upper bound could be based on the trivial ruler where marks are at positions 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, ... (triangular numbers), but we can use a simpler bound like `m*(m-1)` which should be sufficient for most cases.

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Ordering constraint**: The marks must be in strictly increasing order: `marks[i] < marks[i+1]` for all valid i
   - **Distinct differences constraint**: All pairwise differences `marks[j] - marks[i]` for `i < j` must be distinct
   - **Symmetry breaking constraint**: `marks[2] - marks[1] < marks[m] - marks[m-1]`, which means the first difference is less than the last difference

4. **Objective Function**: This is an optimization problem where we want to minimize the length of the ruler, which is `marks[m]` (the position of the last mark).

5. **Modeling Choices**: 
   - We'll use a 1-indexed array for marks to match the mathematical notation
   - For the distinct differences constraint, we need to create an array of all possible differences and ensure they are all different
   - The number of differences is exactly `m*(m-1)/2` as stated in the problem

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Golomb Ruler Problem
% Find a set of m marks with minimum length such that all pairwise differences are distinct

% Parameters
int: m;  % number of marks

% Upper bound for mark positions (can be adjusted for better performance)
int: max_length = m * (m - 1);

% Decision variables
array[1..m] of var 0..max_length: marks;

% The first mark is always at position 0
constraint marks[1] = 0;

% Marks must be in strictly increasing order
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1) (
    marks[i] < marks[i+1]
);

% All pairwise differences must be distinct
% Create array of all differences
int: num_diffs = m * (m - 1) div 2;
array[1..num_diffs] of var 1..max_length: differences;

% Map differences to the difference array
constraint 
    let {
        array[1..num_diffs] of int: diff_indices = 
            [i * m + j - (i * (i + 1)) div 2 | i in 1..m-1, j in i+1..m]
    } in
    forall(k in 1..num_diffs) (
        let {
            int: i = min([i | i in 1..m-1 where exists(j in i+1..m) 
                         (i * m + j - (i * (i + 1)) div 2 = k)]),
            int: j = min([j | j in 2..m where exists(i in 1..j-1) 
                         (i * m + j - (i * (i + 1)) div 2 = k)])
        } in
        differences[k] = marks[j] - marks[i]
    );

% Simpler approach for the differences constraint
constraint
    let {
        array[1..num_diffs] of var 1..max_length: diffs = 
            [marks[j] - marks[i] | i in 1..m-1, j in i+1..m]
    } in
    alldifferent(diffs);

% Symmetry breaking: first difference < last difference
constraint marks[2] - marks[1] < marks[m] - marks[m-1];

% Objective: minimize the length of the ruler
var 0..max_length: length = marks[m];
solve minimize length;

% Output
output [
    "Marks: " ++ show(marks) ++ "\n" ++
    "Length: " ++ show(length) ++ "\n" ++
    "Differences: " ++ show([marks[j] - marks[i] | i in 1..m-1, j in i+1..m]) ++ "\n"
];
