**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to determine the positions of m beacons along a straight path. Let's call these positions `pos[1..m]` where `pos[i]` represents the position of beacon i.

2. **Domains**: Since we want to minimize the total length and positions are non-negative integers along a path, each position can be in the range `0..upper_bound` where upper_bound needs to be estimated. The first beacon is fixed at position 0.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `pos[1] = 0` (first beacon at position 0)
   - `pos[i] <= pos[i+1]` for all i (beacons are ordered along the path)
   - All pairwise distances must be unique: for any two pairs of beacons (i,j) and (k,l), if (i,j) ≠ (k,l), then |pos[i] - pos[j]| ≠ |pos[k] - pos[l]|

4. **Objective**: Minimize the total design length, which is the position of the last beacon: `minimize pos[m]`

5. **Modeling considerations**: 
   - Since positions are ordered, distances between beacons i and j where i < j is simply `pos[j] - pos[i]`
   - We need to ensure all pairwise distances are different
   - For m beacons, there are C(m,2) = m*(m-1)/2 pairs, so we need that many unique distances
   - An upper bound estimate: in the worst case, if we need distances 1,2,3,...,C(m,2), the last position would be around C(m,2), but this is quite loose

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Signal beacon positioning problem
% Minimize path length while ensuring all pairwise distances are unique

int: m; % number of beacons

% Upper bound estimation: for m beacons we need m*(m-1)/2 unique distances
% In worst case, distances could be 1,2,3,...,m*(m-1)/2
% So maximum position could be sum of largest distances
int: max_pos = m * (m - 1) * (m + 1) div 6;

% Decision variables: positions of beacons along the path
array[1..m] of var 0..max_pos: pos;

% First beacon is always at position 0
constraint pos[1] = 0;

% Beacons are ordered along the path (non-decreasing positions)
constraint forall(i in 1..m-1) (
    pos[i] <= pos[i+1]
);

% All pairwise distances must be unique
% For beacons i < j, distance is pos[j] - pos[i]
constraint forall(i1, j1, i2, j2 in 1..m where 
    i1 < j1 /\ i2 < j2 /\ (i1 != i2 \/ j1 != j2)) (
    pos[j1] - pos[i1] != pos[j2] - pos[i2]
);

% Minimize the total design length (position of last beacon)
solve minimize pos[m];

% Output the solution
output ["Beacon positions: "] ++ 
       [show(pos[i]) ++ if i < m then ", " else "\n" endif | i in 1..m] ++
       ["Total length: " ++ show(pos[m]) ++ "\n"] ++
       ["Distances: "] ++
       [show(pos[j] - pos[i]) ++ " " | i in 1..m, j in i+1..m];
