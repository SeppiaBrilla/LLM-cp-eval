Reasoning:
1. The Sudoku board is a 9x9 grid. Each cell is a variable with domain 1..9.
2. Constraint: Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain all digits 1..9 exactly once.
3. Pre-filled cells should have fixed values.
4. This is a satisfaction problem (no objective function).

MiniZinc model:
```minizinc
% Sudoku solver
array[1..9, 1..9] of var 1..9: grid;

constraint
  forall(i in 1..9) (
    alldifferent([grid[i, j] | j in 1..9])
  )
  /\ forall(j in 1..9) (
    alldifferent([grid[i, j] | i in 1..9])
  )
  /\ forall(r in 0..2, c in 0..2) (
    alldifferent([grid[3*r + i, 3*c + j] | i, j in 1..3])
  );

/* Add constraints for pre-filled cells as needed:
constraint grid[1,1] = 5;
...
*/

solve satisfy;
```
This model will find a solution to the Sudoku puzzle if one exists. The `alldifferent` constraint ensures that all digits 1..9 appear exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 box. The `solve satisfy` statement tells MiniZinc to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.
