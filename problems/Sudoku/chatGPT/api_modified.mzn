Reasoning:

1. The game board is a 9x9 grid. Each cell is a variable with domain 0..9, where 0 represents an empty cell and 1..9 represent queens with different garments.

2. Decision Variables: The decision variables are the cells of the 9x9 grid. Each cell can take a value from 0 to 9, where 0 represents an empty cell and 1..9 represent queens with different garments.

3. Domains: The domain of each cell is 0..9.

4. Constraints: 
   - Each row, column, and 3x3 block must not contain any two queens of the same garment.
   - Pre-filled cells should have fixed values.

5. Objective Function: The objective is to maximize the number of queens on the board. This can be achieved by maximizing the sum of all cells, as each queen contributes a value of 1..9 to the sum, while empty cells contribute 0.

6. This is an optimization problem, as we are trying to maximize the number of queens on the board.

7. Simplifications: We can simplify the problem by treating it as a variant of the Sudoku problem, where each cell can take a value from 0 to 9, and the constraints are similar to those of Sudoku.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Game solver
array[1..9, 1..9] of var 0..9: grid;

% Constraint: Each row, column, and 3x3 block must not contain any two queens of the same garment.
constraint
  forall(i in 1..9) (
    forall(g in 1..9) (
      sum(j in 1..9)(grid[i, j] = g) <= 1
    )
  )
  /\ forall(j in 1..9) (
    forall(g in 1..9) (
      sum(i in 1..9)(grid[i, j] = g) <= 1
    )
  )
  /\ forall(r in 0..2, c in 0..2) (
    forall(g in 1..9) (
      sum(i, j in 1..3)(grid[3*r + i, 3*c + j] = g) <= 1
    )
  );

% Add constraints for pre-filled cells as needed:
% constraint grid[4,7] = 1; % blue_queen

% Objective: Maximize the number of queens on the board.
solve maximize sum(i in 1..9, j in 1..9)(grid[i, j]);

output [ "grid = \(grid)" ];
```

In the above model, replace the comment `% constraint grid[4,7] = 1; % blue_queen` with the actual pre-filled cells. The number `1` represents the blue_queen. If there are other pre-filled cells, add similar constraints for them.
