Reasoning:

1. **Decision Variables**: The decision variables are the cells of the chess board. Each cell can contain a queen of a certain garment or be empty. We can represent the board as a 2D array of integer variables, where each integer represents a different garment (e.g., 0 for empty, 1 for white hat, 2 for green hat, etc.). We also need to consider the pre-filled spots as part of our decision variables.

2. **Domains**: The domain of each cell is {0, 1, 2, ..., n}, where n is the number of different garments. 0 represents an empty cell, and the other numbers represent the different garments.

3. **Constraints**: The constraints are as follows:
   - No two queens of the same garment can be in the same row, column, or block.
   - The pre-filled spots must contain the specified queens.

4. **Objective Function**: The objective is to maximize the number of queens on the board. This can be achieved by maximizing the sum of all cells in the board (since 0 represents an empty cell and the other numbers represent queens).

5. **Simplifications or Modeling Choices**: We can simplify the problem by treating the pre-filled spots as fixed variables, which reduces the number of decision variables. We can also simplify the block constraint by dividing the board into 3x3 blocks and ensuring that no two queens of the same garment are in the same block.

MiniZinc model:
```minizinc
% Define the size of the board and the number of garments
int: n = 9;
int: num_garments = 3;  % for example

% Define the board
array[1..n, 1..n] of var 0..num_garments: board;

% Define the pre-filled spots
% For example, cell[3,6] = blue_queen
% We represent blue_queen as 2
constraint board[3,6] = 2;

% No two queens of the same garment can be in the same row or column
include "alldifferent.mzn";
constraint forall(i in 1..n) (
  alldifferent([board[i,j] | j in 1..n]) /\ 
  alldifferent([board[j,i] | j in 1..n])
);

% No two queens of the same garment can be in the same block
constraint forall(bi in 0..2, bj in 0..2) (
  alldifferent([board[i+bi*3,j+bj*3] | i in 1..3, j in 1..3])
);

% Maximize the number of queens on the board
solve maximize sum(i in 1..n, j in 1..n) (if board[i,j] > 0 then 1 else 0 endif);
```
This model assumes that the number of garments is less than or equal to the size of the board. If there are more garments than the size of the board, the model needs to be adjusted accordingly.
