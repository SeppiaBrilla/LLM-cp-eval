Reasoning:

1. **Decision Variables**: The decision variables are the positions of the queens on the chess board. We can represent the board as a 2D array of size n x n, where n = 9. Each cell in the array can take a value from 1 to n, representing the type of queen (with a specific garment) placed in that cell. If a cell is empty, it can be represented by 0.

2. **Domains**: The domain of each cell in the array is {0, 1, 2, ..., n}, where 0 represents an empty cell and 1 to n represent the different types of queens.

3. **Constraints**: The constraints are as follows:
   - Each cell in the array must contain a queen.
   - No two queens of the same type can attack each other. This means that no two queens of the same type can be in the same row, the same column, or the same block.
   - Some cells are pre-filled, and these values must be respected.

4. This is a satisfaction problem, as we are looking for a configuration of the chess board that satisfies all the constraints, without any optimization objective.

5. **Potential Simplifications or Modeling Choices**: We can simplify the problem by treating it as a variant of the Sudoku problem, where each cell in the grid must contain a unique value in its row, column, and block. The difference here is that we have n different types of queens instead of numbers, and each type of queen has its own set of constraints.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Define the size of the chess board
int: n = 9;

% Define the types of queens
set of int: QUEEN_TYPES = 1..n;

% Define the chess board as a 2D array
array[1..n, 1..n] of var QUEEN_TYPES: board;

% Pre-filled spots
% For example, cell[3,6] = blue_queen
% Replace 'blue_queen' with the corresponding integer value
% board[3,6] = blue_queen;

% Each cell in the board must contain a queen
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in 1..n) (
  board[i,j] in QUEEN_TYPES
);

% No two queens of the same type can attack each other
% This means that no two queens of the same type can be in the same row, the same column, or the same block
constraint forall(q in QUEEN_TYPES) (
  % No two queens of the same type in the same row
  forall(i in 1..n) (
    sum(j in 1..n) (bool2int(board[i,j] = q)) <= 1
  ) /\
  % No two queens of the same type in the same column
  forall(j in 1..n) (
    sum(i in 1..n) (bool2int(board[i,j] = q)) <= 1
  ) /\
  % No two queens of the same type in the same block
  forall(bi in 1..3, bj in 1..3) (
    sum(i in (bi-1)*3+1..bi*3, j in (bj-1)*3+1..bj*3) (bool2int(board[i,j] = q)) <= 1
  )
);

% Solve the problem
solve satisfy;
```

Note: In the above model, replace 'blue_queen' with the corresponding integer value for the pre-filled spot. The model assumes that the types of queens are represented by integers from 1 to n.
