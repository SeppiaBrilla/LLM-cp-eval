**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to represent what's placed on each cell of the 9x9 board. Each cell can either be empty or contain a queen with a specific garment type.

2. **Garment Types**: We need to define the different garment types. Since the problem mentions maximizing garment variety, I'll assume we have multiple garment types (white hat, green hat, blue, etc.). Let's use integers where 0 = empty, and 1,2,3,... represent different garment types.

3. **Attacking Cliques**: Each queen belongs to exactly one attacking clique type:
   - Row clique: queens attack others in the same row
   - Column clique: queens attack others in the same column  
   - Block clique: queens attack others in the same 3x3 block

4. **Constraints**:
   - No two queens with the same garment can attack each other within their attacking clique
   - Pre-filled positions must be respected
   - Each queen must be assigned to exactly one attacking clique type

5. **Objective**: Maximize the number of different garment types present on the board

6. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Use a 2D array for the board with garment types (0 for empty)
   - Use another 2D array to specify which attacking clique each queen belongs to
   - Need helper functions to determine which block a position belongs to

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Chess-inspired game with queens, garments, and attacking cliques
% Board size
int: n = 9;

% Garment types (0 = empty, 1+ = different garment types)
int: max_garments = 10; % Adjust based on how many garment types you want
set of int: GARMENTS = 0..max_garments;

% Attacking clique types
int: ROW_CLIQUE = 1;
int: COL_CLIQUE = 2;
int: BLOCK_CLIQUE = 3;
set of int: CLIQUE_TYPES = 1..3;

% Decision variables
array[0..n-1, 0..n-1] of var GARMENTS: board;
array[0..n-1, 0..n-1] of var 0..3: clique_type; % 0 if empty, 1-3 for clique types

% Helper function to determine which 3x3 block a position belongs to
function int: get_block(int: row, int: col) = 
  (row div 3) * 3 + (col div 3);

% Constraint: clique_type is 0 iff the cell is empty
constraint forall(i in 0..n-1, j in 0..n-1) (
  (board[i,j] = 0) <-> (clique_type[i,j] = 0)
);

% Constraint: No attacks within the same garment and clique combination
% Row clique attacks
constraint forall(i in 0..n-1, j1, j2 in 0..n-1 where j1 < j2) (
  (clique_type[i,j1] = ROW_CLIQUE /\ clique_type[i,j2] = ROW_CLIQUE /\ 
   board[i,j1] > 0 /\ board[i,j2] > 0) ->
  (board[i,j1] != board[i,j2])
);

% Column clique attacks  
constraint forall(j in 0..n-1, i1, i2 in 0..n-1 where i1 < i2) (
  (clique_type[i1,j] = COL_CLIQUE /\ clique_type[i2,j] = COL_CLIQUE /\ 
   board[i1,j] > 0 /\ board[i2,j] > 0) ->
  (board[i1,j] != board[i2,j])
);

% Block clique attacks
constraint forall(i1, j1, i2, j2 in 0..n-1 where (i1,j1) != (i2,j2)) (
  (clique_type[i1,j1] = BLOCK_CLIQUE /\ clique_type[i2,j2] = BLOCK_CLIQUE /\ 
   get_block(i1,j1) = get_block(i2,j2) /\
   board[i1,j1] > 0 /\ board[i2,j2] > 0) ->
  (board[i1,j1] != board[i2,j2])
);

% Pre-filled constraints (example - modify as needed)
% constraint board[3,6] = 3; % blue queen (assuming blue = garment type 3)
% constraint clique_type[3,6] = ROW_CLIQUE; % specify its clique type
% Add more pre-filled constraints as needed

% Objective: maximize number of different garment types on board
var int: num_garment_types = sum(g in 1..max_garments) (
  bool2int(exists(i in 0..n-1, j in 0..n-1) (board[i,j] = g))
);

solve maximize num_garment_types;
