**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to represent what queen (if any) is placed at each cell of the 9×9 board. Since queens have different garments and we want to maximize the number of different garments, we need variables that can represent different garment types or no queen at all.

2. **Domains**: Each cell can either be empty or contain a queen with a specific garment. Let's say we have garment types 1, 2, 3, ... up to some maximum number of garments, and 0 represents an empty cell.

3. **Constraints**: 
   - Pre-filled positions must be respected
   - No two queens with the same garment can attack each other within the same attacking clique (row, column, or 3×3 block)
   - Queens with different garments can coexist in the same attacking clique without conflict

4. **Objective Function**: Maximize the number of different garment types present on the board.

5. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Use a 2D array `board[1..9, 1..9]` where each cell contains 0 (empty) or a garment type (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - For the 3×3 blocks, we need to map each cell (i,j) to its block number
   - The maximum number of garments we could theoretically place is limited by the constraint structure
   - We need to handle pre-filled positions as fixed constraints

6. **Block Mapping**: Each cell (i,j) belongs to block `((i-1) div 3) * 3 + ((j-1) div 3) + 1` (using 1-based indexing).

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Chess-inspired game with garmented queens
% Maximize number of different garments while avoiding attacks within cliques

% Board size
int: n = 9;

% Maximum number of possible garment types (upper bound)
int: max_garments = 9;

% Decision variables: board[i,j] = 0 (empty) or garment type (1..max_garments)
array[1..n, 1..n] of var 0..max_garments: board;

% Pre-filled positions (example: board[4,7] = 1 for blue queen at position (3,6) in 0-based)
% Adjust these constraints based on your specific pre-filled positions
constraint board[4,7] = 1; % Example: blue queen at (3,6) - adjust as needed

% Function to determine which 3x3 block a cell belongs to
function int: get_block(int: i, int: j) = 
    ((i-1) div 3) * 3 + ((j-1) div 3) + 1;

% Constraint: No two queens with same garment can attack each other in same row
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j1, j2 in 1..n where j1 < j2)(
    if board[i,j1] > 0 /\ board[i,j2] > 0 then
        board[i,j1] != board[i,j2]
    else true endif
);

% Constraint: No two queens with same garment can attack each other in same column  
constraint forall(j in 1..n, i1, i2 in 1..n where i1 < i2)(
    if board[i1,j] > 0 /\ board[i2,j] > 0 then
        board[i1,j] != board[i2,j]
    else true endif
);

% Constraint: No two queens with same garment can attack each other in same 3x3 block
constraint forall(i1, j1, i2, j2 in 1..n where (i1,j1) != (i2,j2))(
    if get_block(i1,j1) = get_block(i2,j2) /\ 
       board[i1,j1] > 0 /\ board[i2,j2] > 0 then
        board[i1,j1] != board[i2,j2]
    else true endif
);

% Objective: Maximize number of different garment types on the board
var int: num_garments = sum(g in 1..max_garments)(
    if exists(i,j in 1..n)(board[i,j] = g) then 1 else 0 endif
);

solve maximize num_garments;

% Output

    "Board configuration:\n"
