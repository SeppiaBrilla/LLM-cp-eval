**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need to represent what queen (if any) is placed at each cell of the 9×9 board. Since queens have different garments and we want to maximize the number of different garments, we need variables that can represent different garment types or no queen at all.

2. **Domains**: Each cell can either be empty or contain a queen with a specific garment. Let's say we have garment types 1, 2, 3, ... up to some maximum number of garments, and 0 represents an empty cell.

3. **Constraints**: 
   - Pre-filled positions must be respected
   - No two queens with the same garment can attack each other within the same attacking clique (row, column, or 3×3 block)
   - Queens with different garments can coexist in the same attacking clique without conflict

4. **Objective Function**: Maximize the number of different garment types present on the board.

5. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Use a 2D array `board[1..9, 1..9]` where 0 = empty, and positive integers represent different garments
   - For blocks, we need a function to determine which 3×3 block a cell belongs to
   - The constraint "no attack within same garment and same clique" can be modeled as: for each garment type, no two cells in the same row/column/block can both have that garment
   - To maximize garment diversity, we can use a boolean array to track which garments are used and maximize the sum

6. **Block Mapping**: Each cell (i,j) belongs to block `((i-1) div 3) * 3 + ((j-1) div 3) + 1`, giving us blocks numbered 1-9.

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Chess-inspired game with garmented queens
% Maximize garment diversity while avoiding attacks within same garment cliques

% Board size
int: n = 9;

% Maximum number of different garments we might use
int: max_garments = 9;

% Decision variables: board[i,j] = 0 (empty) or garment_type (1..max_garments)
array[1..n, 1..n] of var 0..max_garments: board;

% Track which garments are actually used
array[1..max_garments] of var bool: garment_used;

% Pre-filled positions (example - modify as needed)
% constraint board[4,7] = 1; % blue queen at position (3,6) in 0-indexed = (4,7) in 1-indexed

% Link garment usage with board state
constraint forall(g in 1..max_garments)(
    garment_used[g] <-> exists(i,j in 1..n)(board[i,j] = g)
);

% Function to determine which 3x3 block a cell belongs to (1-9)
function int: get_block(int: i, int: j) = 
    ((i-1) div 3) * 3 + ((j-1) div 3) + 1;

% No attacks within same garment - Row constraint
constraint forall(g in 1..max_garments, i in 1..n)(
    sum(j in 1..n)(board[i,j] = g) <= 1
);

% No attacks within same garment - Column constraint  
constraint forall(g in 1..max_garments, j in 1..n)(
    sum(i in 1..n)(board[i,j] = g) <= 1
);

% No attacks within same garment - Block constraint
constraint forall(g in 1..max_garments, b in 1..9)(
    sum(i,j in 1..n where get_block(i,j) = b)(board[i,j] = g) <= 1
);

% Objective: maximize number of different garments used
var int: num_garments_used = sum(g in 1..max_garments)(garment_used[g]);
solve maximize num_garments_used;

% Output
output [
    "Board configuration:\n"

    if j = 1 then "Row " ++ show(i) ++ ": " else "" endif ++
