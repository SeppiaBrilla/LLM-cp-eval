**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: We need a 9×9 grid of integer variables, where each cell can contain a digit from 1 to 9. Let's call this `sudoku[i,j]` where `i` and `j` range from 1 to 9.

2. **Domain**: Each variable `sudoku[i,j]` has domain `1..9` since each cell must contain exactly one digit from 1 to 9.

3. **Constraints**: We need to encode three types of constraints:
   - **Row constraints**: For each row `i`, all digits 1-9 must appear exactly once across columns 1-9
   - **Column constraints**: For each column `j`, all digits 1-9 must appear exactly once across rows 1-9  
   - **Box constraints**: For each 3×3 box, all digits 1-9 must appear exactly once within that box

4. **Box indexing**: The nine 3×3 boxes can be identified by their top-left corners: (1,1), (1,4), (1,7), (4,1), (4,4), (4,7), (7,1), (7,4), (7,7). Each box contains cells `[r..r+2, c..c+2]` where `(r,c)` is the top-left corner.

5. **Problem type**: This is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) - we want to find any valid assignment that satisfies all constraints. No optimization objective is needed.

6. **Initial values**: In a typical Sudoku puzzle, some cells would be pre-filled with given digits. We can model this by adding equality constraints for those cells, but for a general solver, we'll leave the grid initially unconstrained.

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Sudoku Solver
% 9x9 grid with digits 1-9, subject to row, column, and box constraints

% Decision variables: 9x9 grid of digits
array[1..9, 1..9] of var 1..9: sudoku;

% Row constraints: each row contains all digits 1-9 exactly once
constraint forall(i in 1..9) (
    alldifferent([sudoku[i,j] | j in 1..9])
);

% Column constraints: each column contains all digits 1-9 exactly once  
constraint forall(j in 1..9) (
    alldifferent([sudoku[i,j] | i in 1..9])
);

% Box constraints: each 3x3 box contains all digits 1-9 exactly once
constraint forall(box_row in 0..2, box_col in 0..2) (
    alldifferent([sudoku[3*box_row + r, 3*box_col + c] | r in 1..3, c in 1..3])
);

% Example: Uncomment and modify the following lines to set initial clues
% constraint sudoku[1,1] = 5;
% constraint sudoku[1,2] = 3;
% constraint sudoku[2,1] = 8;
% Add more initial constraints as needed for specific puzzles

% Output formatting
output [
    if j = 1 then "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(sudoku[i,j]) ++
    if j = 9 then "\n" else "" endif
    | i in 1..9, j in 1..9
];
```
