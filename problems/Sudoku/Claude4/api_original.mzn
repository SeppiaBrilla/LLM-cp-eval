**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision variables**: We need a 9×9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9. This gives us 81 decision variables, which we can represent as a 2D array `grid[1..9, 1..9]` with domain `1..9`.

2. **Domains**: Each cell variable has domain `1..9` representing the possible digits that can be placed in that cell.

3. **Constraints**: We need to enforce three types of constraints:
   - **Row constraints**: Each of the 9 rows must contain all digits 1-9 exactly once (alldifferent constraint)
   - **Column constraints**: Each of the 9 columns must contain all digits 1-9 exactly once (alldifferent constraint)  
   - **Box constraints**: Each of the 9 3×3 subgrids must contain all digits 1-9 exactly once (alldifferent constraint)

4. **Problem type**: This is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) - we want to find any solution that satisfies all constraints, so we use `solve satisfy` rather than optimizing an objective function.

5. **Modeling considerations**: 
   - The 3×3 boxes can be indexed systematically: box (r,c) where r,c ∈ {0,1,2} contains cells from rows 3r+1 to 3r+3 and columns 3c+1 to 3c+3
   - Pre-filled cells (clues) can be added as additional equality constraints
   - MiniZinc's `alldifferent` global constraint is perfect for ensuring each group contains distinct values

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Sudoku solver
% 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit 1-9
array[1..9, 1..9] of var 1..9: grid;

% Row constraints: each row contains digits 1-9 exactly once
constraint
  forall(i in 1..9) (
    alldifferent([grid[i, j] | j in 1..9])
  );

% Column constraints: each column contains digits 1-9 exactly once  
constraint
  forall(j in 1..9) (
    alldifferent([grid[i, j] | i in 1..9])
  );

% Box constraints: each 3x3 subgrid contains digits 1-9 exactly once
constraint
  forall(box_row in 0..2, box_col in 0..2) (
    alldifferent([grid[3*box_row + i, 3*box_col + j] | i, j in 1..3])
  );

% Pre-filled cells (clues) - add constraints for known values
% Example clues (uncomment and modify as needed):
% constraint grid[1,1] = 5;
% constraint grid[1,3] = 8;
% constraint grid[2,2] = 7;
% ... add more clues here

solve satisfy;

% Output formatting
output [
  if j = 1 then "\n" else " " endif ++
  show(grid[i,j])
  | i in 1..9, j in 1..9
] ++ ["\n"];
