**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves placing queens on a 9x9 board such that each cell contains exactly one queen, and each queen has a garment (digit from 1 to 9). The key constraint is that no two queens with the same garment can be in the same row, column, or 3x3 block. This is equivalent to the standard Sudoku constraints: each row, column, and block must contain all garments from 1 to 9 exactly once.

2. **Variables**: We need a 9x9 grid of variables, each representing the garment assigned to a cell. The domain for each variable is integers from 1 to 9.

3. **Domains**: Each variable in the grid has a domain of {1, 2, ..., 9}, corresponding to the possible garments.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Row Constraints**: For each row, all garments must be distinct.
   - **Column Constraints**: For each column, all garments must be distinct.
   - **Block Constraints**: For each of the 9 blocks (defined as 3x3 regions), all garments must be distinct. The blocks are computed using integer division and modulus based on block indices (0 to 8).

5. **Fixed Values**: Some cells have pre-assigned garments (e.g., cell[3,6] = blue_queen). These are handled as additional equality constraints. In the model, fixed values can be added directly as constraints or via a parameter array for flexibility.

6. **Objective**: This is a constraint satisfaction problem with no objective function; we seek any valid assignment.

7. **Modeling Choices**: Use 0-based indexing for rows and columns (0 to 8) to match the problem description. The blocks are defined dynamically using calculations for row and column ranges.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% MiniZinc model for placing queens with garments on a 9x9 board
% Constraints: No two same-garment queens in same row, column, or block.

% Sets for rows, columns, garments, and blocks
set of int: ROW = 0..8;
set of int: COL = 0..8;
set of int: GARMENT = 1..9;
set of int: BLOCK = 0..8;

% Decision variable: grid of garments
array[ROW, COL] of var GARMENT: queen;

% Constraints for rows: all different in each row
constraint forall(r in ROW) (
    all_different([queen[r, c] | c in COL])
);

% Constraints for columns: all different in each column
constraint forall(c in COL) (
    all_different([queen[r, c] | r in ROW])
);

% Constraints for blocks: all different in each 3x3 block
% Blocks are defined as:
%   Block 0: rows 0-2, cols 0-2
%   Block 1: rows 0-2, cols 3-5
%   Block 2: rows 0-2, cols 6-8
%   Block 3: rows 3-5, cols 0-2
%   Block 4: rows 3-5, cols 3-5
%   Block 5: rows 3-5, cols 6-8
%   Block 6: rows 6-8, cols 0-2
%   Block 7: rows 6-8, cols 3-5
%   Block 8: rows 6-8, cols 6-8
% Using integer division and modulus to compute block regions
constraint forall(b in BLOCK) (
    all_different([queen[r, c] | 
        r in {3 * (b div 3), 3 * (b div 3) + 1, 3 * (b div 3) + 2}, 
        c in {3 * (b mod 3), 3 * (b mod 3) + 1, 3 * (b mod 3) + 2}
    ])
);

% Example fixed value: cell at row 3, column 6 has garment 1 (e.g., blue_queen)
% Add more fixed constraints as needed for pre-filled spots.
constraint queen[3, 6] = 1;

% Solve to find a valid assignment
solve satisfy;

% Output the grid in a readable format
output [
    if c = 0 then "\n" else "" endif ++
    show(queen[r, c]) ++ " "
    | r in ROW, c in COL
];
```

**Note:** The fixed value constraint `queen[3, 6] = 1` is an example. In practice, multiple fixed constraints can be added similarly. For a more flexible approach, a parameter array can be used to define initial values, but this model uses direct constraints for simplicity.
