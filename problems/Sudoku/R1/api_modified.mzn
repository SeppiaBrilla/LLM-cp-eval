**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Overview**: We need to place exactly 9 queens on a 9x9 board, each with a garment (represented by an integer from 1 to 9). The goal is to maximize the number of distinct garments used, while ensuring that no two queens with the same garment attack each other. Attacks occur only if queens share the same garment and are in the same "attacking clique" (row, column, or 3x3 block).

2. **Decision Variables**: 
   - A 9x9 grid where each cell can hold a value from 0 to 9. Value 0 indicates no queen, and values 1-9 represent the garment type.
   - Additional variables to track which garment values are used, for the objective.

3. **Domains**:
   - Grid cells: integers from 0 to 9.
   - Garment usage: Boolean for each garment value 1..9.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Exactly 9 queens**: The sum of non-zero values in the grid must be 9.
   - **Row attacks avoided**: In each row, all non-zero garment values must be distinct.
   - **Column attacks avoided**: In each column, all non-zero garment values must be distinct.
   - **Block attacks avoided**: In each 3x3 block, all non-zero garment values must be distinct.
   - **Pre-filled spots**: Some cells may have fixed garment values (e.g., cell (3,6) fixed to a specific garment).

5. **Objective Function**: Maximize the number of distinct garment values used (i.e., the count of garment values from 1 to 9 that appear in the grid).

6. **Modeling Choices**:
   - Garments are represented as integers 1..9 for simplicity, but could be mapped to symbolic names (e.g., 1 for "blue").
   - Attack constraints are implemented by ensuring alldifferent conditions on non-zero values in each clique, using pairwise comparisons.
   - Blocks are defined as 3x3 regions with indices 1..9 for rows and columns.

7. **Simplifications**:
   - Since only 9 queens are placed, the maximum distinct garments is 9, but pre-filled spots or placement constraints may reduce this.
   - The model uses a grid-based approach for clarity, with constraints expressed over all pairs in each clique.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Queens with Garments Problem
% Place 9 queens on a 9x9 board with garments 1..9, avoiding attacks in rows, columns, and blocks.
% Maximize the number of distinct garments used.

% Sets for rows and columns
set of int: ROWS = 1..9;
set of int: COLS = 1..9;
% Garments are represented as integers 1..9
set of int: GARMENTS = 1..9;

% Decision variable: grid[i,j] = 0 if no queen, or garment value 1..9 if queen
array[ROWS, COLS] of var 0..9: grid;

% Constraint: Exactly 9 queens are placed
constraint sum([grid[i,j] != 0 | i in ROWS, j in COLS]) = 9;

% Constraint: In each row, all non-zero garment values are distinct
constraint forall(i in ROWS) (
    forall(j, k in COLS where j < k) (
        if grid[i,j] != 0 /\ grid[i,k] != 0 then grid[i,j] != grid[i,k] else true endif
    )
);

% Constraint: In each column, all non-zero garment values are distinct
constraint forall(j in COLS) (
    forall(i, k in ROWS where i < k) (
        if grid[i,j] != 0 /\ grid[k,j] != 0 then grid[i,j] != grid[k,j] else true endif
    )
);

% Define blocks: 3x3 regions
% Block indices: 1..9, where block b corresponds to:
%   rows: 3*((b-1) div 3) + 1 .. 3*((b-1) div 3) + 3
%   cols: 3*((b-1) mod 3) + 1 .. 3*((b-1) mod 3) + 3
constraint forall(b in 1..9) (
    let {
        int: start_row = 3 * ((b-1) div 3) + 1,
        int: end_row = start_row + 2,
        int: start_col = 3 * ((b-1) mod 3) + 1,
        int: end_col = start_col + 2
    } in
    forall(i1, j1, i2, j2 in start_row..end_row, start_col..end_col where (i1, j1) != (i2, j2)) (
        if grid[i1,j1] != 0 /\ grid[i2,j2] != 0 then grid[i1,j1] != grid[i2,j2] else true endif
    )
);

% Pre-filled spots: Example: cell (3,6) is fixed to garment 1 (e.g., blue_queen)
% Uncomment and modify as needed for specific pre-filled assignments
% constraint grid[3,6] = 1; % blue_queen represented as 1

% Variables to track which garments are used
array[GARMENTS] of var bool: used_garment;

% Constraint: used_garment[g] is true if garment g appears in the grid
constraint forall(g in GARMENTS) (
    used_garment[g] <-> exists(i in ROWS, j in COLS) (grid[i,j] == g)
);

% Objective: Maximize the number of distinct garments used
solve maximize sum(used_garment);

% Output: Display the grid and distinct garment count
output [
    "Grid:\n" ++ 
    show2d(grid) ++ 
    "\nNumber of distinct garments: " ++ show(sum(used_garment))
];
```

**Notes:**
- The model uses integers 1-9 for garments; map these to symbolic names (e.g., 1 for "blue") as needed.
- Pre-filled spots can be added as constraints on specific grid cells (e.g., `constraint grid[3,6] = 1;` for a blue queen at (3,6)).
- The output shows the grid and the count of distinct garments.
