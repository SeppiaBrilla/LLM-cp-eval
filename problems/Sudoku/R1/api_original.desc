**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Type**: Sudoku is a constraint satisfaction problem where the goal is to assign digits 1–9 to a 9×9 grid such that specific constraints are met. There is no objective function to optimize.

2. **Decision Variables**: The primary decision variables are the values in each cell of the grid. I will use a 2D array `grid` of size 9×9, where each element is a variable with domain 1..9.

3. **Domains**: Each variable in `grid` must be an integer between 1 and 9.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Row Constraint**: Each row must contain all digits 1–9 exactly once. This can be enforced using the `all_different` constraint applied to each row.
   - **Column Constraint**: Each column must contain all digits 1–9 exactly once. Similarly, `all_different` is applied to each column.
   - **Box Constraint**: The grid is divided into nine 3×3 subgrids (boxes). Each box must contain all digits 1–9 exactly once. To model this, I will iterate over the boxes using indices 0..2 for row and column groups, and apply `all_different` to the cells in each 3×3 region.

5. **Initial Values**: Although not explicitly required, Sudoku puzzles typically start with some pre-filled cells. To handle this, I include an optional parameter `initial` (a 9×9 integer array) where non-zero values represent fixed clues. Constraints are added to force `grid` to match `initial` where clues are given. If no initial values are provided, all elements of `initial` can be set to 0 (default), meaning no additional constraints.

6. **Output**: The solution should display the filled grid in a readable format, with rows and columns clearly represented.

7. **Simplifications**: The model uses standard MiniZinc constraints and comprehensions for clarity. The box constraints are handled by iterating over box indices and collecting cells in each box.

**MiniZinc Model:**

```minizinc
% Sudoku Model in MiniZinc
% The grid is a 9x9 array of digits from 1 to 9.
% Constraints ensure all rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes contain distinct digits.

% Optional: Initial grid with clues (0 means unknown)
array[1..9, 1..9] of int: initial = array2d(1..9, 1..9, [0 | i in 1..81]);

% Decision variable: the Sudoku grid
array[1..9, 1..9] of var 1..9: grid;

% Constraint: Match initial clues where provided
constraint forall(i in 1..9, j in 1..9) (
    if initial[i, j] != 0 then grid[i, j] = initial[i, j] else true endif
);

% Constraint: All digits in each row must be distinct
constraint forall(i in 1..9) (
    all_different([grid[i, j] | j in 1..9])
);

% Constraint: All digits in each column must be distinct
constraint forall(j in 1..9) (
    all_different([grid[i, j] | i in 1..9])
);

% Constraint: All digits in each 3x3 box must be distinct
constraint forall(box_row in 0..2, box_col in 0..2) (
    all_different([grid[i, j] | 
        i in 3*box_row + 1..3*box_row + 3, 
        j in 3*box_col + 1..3*box_col + 3])
);

% Solve the problem (satisfaction)
solve satisfy;

% Output the grid in a readable format
output [ 
    if j == 1 then "\n" else "" endif ++ 
    show(grid[i, j]) ++ 
    if j mod 3 == 0 then "  " else " " endif 
    | i in 1..9, j in 1..9 
];
```

This model defines the Sudoku constraints and includes an optional `initial` parameter for pre-filled cells. The output formats the grid with spaces between 3x3 boxes for readability. To use with a specific puzzle, set the `initial` array accordingly.
