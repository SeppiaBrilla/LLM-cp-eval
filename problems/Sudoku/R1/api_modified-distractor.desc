**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**  
   - We have a 9x9 chessboard (n=9) where we need to place exactly 9 queens, each with a garment type.  
   - Queens can only attack other queens with the same garment if they are in the same row, same column, or same 3x3 block.  
   - The goal is to maximize the number of distinct garment types used among the 9 queens, while ensuring that no two queens with the same garment attack each other.  
   - Some cells are pre-filled with specific garments (e.g., cell (3,6) has a blue_queen).

2. **Key Elements:**  
   - **Board Representation:** Use a 2D array `board` of size 9x9, where each cell can hold a garment type (1-9) or 0 if no queen is present.  
   - **Queens Count:** Exactly 9 cells must have a queen (i.e., `board[i,j] != 0`).  
   - **Attack Constraints:** For each garment type `g`, no two queens with `g` can share the same row, column, or 3x3 block.  
   - **Blocks Definition:** The board is divided into 9 blocks of size 3x3. The block index for a cell (i,j) is computed as `3 * (i div 3) + (j div 3)`.  
   - **Pre-filled Spots:** Fixed assignments must be respected (e.g., `board[3,6] = 1` if blue_queen is garment type 1).  
   - **Objective:** Maximize the number of distinct garment types used, which is the count of `g` in 1..9 for which at least one queen has garment `g`.

3. **Modeling Choices:**  
   - Use 0-based indexing for rows and columns (0..8) to match the block descriptions.  
   - Garment types are represented as integers 1..9, with 0 indicating no queen.  
   - For each garment `g`, enforce:  
     - At most one queen per row.  
     - At most one queen per column.  
     - At most one queen per block.  
   - Define a boolean array `used` to track which garment types are used, and maximize the sum of `used[g]`.  
   - Handle pre-filled spots as constraints that fix `board[i,j]` to specific values.

4. **Constraints Breakdown:**  
   - **Exactly 9 Queens:** The sum of non-zero `board[i,j]` equals 9.  
   - **Row Constraints:** For each garment `g` and row `i`, the number of cells in row `i` with `board[i,j] = g` is at most 1.  
   - **Column Constraints:** For each garment `g` and column `j`, the number of cells in column `j` with `board[i,j] = g` is at most 1.  
   - **Block Constraints:** For each garment `g` and block `b`, the number of cells in block `b` with `board[i,j] = g` is at most 1.  
   - **Fixed Assignments:** Pre-filled cells are set to their specified garment types.

5. **Objective Function:**  
   - Maximize the number of distinct garment types used, i.e., the sum of `used[g]` for `g` in 1..9, where `used[g]` is true if at least one queen has garment `g`.

**MiniZinc Model:**
```minizinc
% MiniZinc model for placing queens with garments on a 9x9 board
% Goal: Maximize distinct garments while avoiding attacks between same-garment queens

% Sets for rows, columns, garments, and blocks
set of int: ROWS = 0..8;
set of int: COLS = 0..8;
set of int: GARMENTS = 1..9;
set of int: BLOCKS = 0..8;

% Decision variable: board[i,j] = garment type (1-9) if queen present, else 0
array[ROWS, COLS] of var 0..9: board;

% Boolean array to track which garment types are used
array[GARMENTS] of var bool: used;

% Constraint: Exactly 9 queens on the board
constraint sum(i in ROWS, j in COLS)(board[i,j] != 0) = 9;

% Constraints for no attacks between same-garment queens:
% For each garment g, at most one queen per row, per column, and per block
constraint forall(g in GARMENTS) (
    forall(i in ROWS) ( sum(j in COLS)(board[i,j] == g) <= 1 ) /\
    forall(j in COLS) ( sum(i in ROWS)(board[i,j] == g) <= 1 )
);

% Block constraints: for each garment g and each block b, at most one queen
constraint forall(b in BLOCKS) (
    let {
        int: start_r = 3 * (b div 3),  % starting row of block b
        int: start_c = 3 * (b mod 3)    % starting column of block b
    } in
    forall(g in GARMENTS) (
        sum(i in start_r..start_r+2, j in start_c..start_c+2)(board[i,j] == g) <= 1
    )
);

% Pre-filled spots: example: cell (3,6) has blue_queen (garment type 1)
constraint board[3,6] = 1;  % Adjust garment type as needed for other fixed cells

% Define used[g] for each garment g: true if at least one queen has garment g
constraint forall(g in GARMENTS) (
    used[g] <-> (sum(i in ROWS, j in COLS)(board[i,j] == g) >= 1)
);

% Objective: Maximize the number of distinct garment types used
solve maximize sum(used);

% Output: Show the board and the distinct garments used
output [
    "Board:\n" ++ 
    show2d(board) ++ 
    "\nDistinct garments used: " ++ show(sum(used)) ++ 
    "\nUsed garments: " ++ show(used)
];
```

**Notes:**
- This model uses 0-based indexing for rows and columns (0..8).
- The pre-filled spot `board[3,6] = 1` is hardcoded; for additional fixed cells, add similar constraints.
- The block computation uses integer division and modulo to determine the 3x3 blocks.
- The objective is to maximize the count of distinct garments, and the output displays the board and usage information.
