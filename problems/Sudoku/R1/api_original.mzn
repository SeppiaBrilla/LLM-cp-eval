**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables**: The Sudoku puzzle is defined on a 9x9 grid. Each cell in this grid must be assigned a digit from 1 to 9. Thus, we define a 2D array of variables with domain 1..9.

2. **Domains**: Each variable (cell) can take values from 1 to 9, representing the digits.

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Rows**: For each row (indexed 1 to 9), all cells in that row must contain distinct digits. This is enforced using the `alldifferent` constraint.
   - **Columns**: Similarly, for each column (indexed 1 to 9), all cells in that column must contain distinct digits.
   - **Boxes**: The grid is divided into nine 3x3 boxes. Each box must contain all digits 1â€“9 exactly once. The boxes are indexed by row and column offsets (0 to 2), and for each box, the cells within the corresponding 3x3 subgrid are constrained to be all different.

4. **Objective**: This is a constraint satisfaction problem; there is no optimization objective. The goal is to find any valid assignment that satisfies all constraints, so we use `solve satisfy`.

5. **Initial Values**: The base model does not include pre-filled cells, as the problem description does not specify any. However, the code includes a comment indicating how to add fixed values for specific puzzles.

6. **Modeling Notes**: The box constraints are modeled using comprehensions with indices calculated based on the box row and column (0 to 2). This ensures that each 3x3 subgrid is covered correctly.

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Sudoku Solver
% The grid is a 9x9 array of variables with domain 1..9.
array[1..9, 1..9] of var 1..9: grid;

% Constraints:
% 1. Each row must contain all digits 1-9 exactly once.
constraint forall(i in 1..9) (
    alldifferent([grid[i, j] | j in 1..9])
);

% 2. Each column must contain all digits 1-9 exactly once.
constraint forall(j in 1..9) (
    alldifferent([grid[i, j] | i in 1..9])
);

% 3. Each 3x3 box must contain all digits 1-9 exactly once.
% Boxes are indexed by row and column from 0 to 2.
constraint forall(r in 0..2, c in 0..2) (
    alldifferent([grid[3*r + i, 3*c + j] | i, j in 1..3])
);

% If pre-filled cells are given, add constraints like:
% constraint grid[1,1] = 5;  % Example fixed value
% ...

% Solve the constraint satisfaction problem.
solve satisfy;

% Optionally, output the grid in a readable format.
output [show(grid[i,j]) ++ if j == 9 then "\n" else " " endif | i in 1..9, j in 1..9];
