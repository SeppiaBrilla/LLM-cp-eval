Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - The assignment of visitor groups to host rooms in each time slot. This can be represented as a 3D array `schedule[visitor, host, slot]` where `visitor` is the visitor group, `host` is the host room, and `slot` is the time slot. The value of `schedule[visitor, host, slot]` is 1 if the visitor group is assigned to the host room in the given time slot, and 0 otherwise.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of `schedule[visitor, host, slot]` is {0, 1}.

3. Constraints:
   - Each visitor group must be assigned to exactly one host room in each time slot.
   - The total number of people in a host room in each time slot cannot exceed the room's capacity.
   - A visitor group cannot attend the same host room twice.
   - Two visitor groups should not meet more than once across the fair.
   - The number of hosts in a room should not exceed the number of slots.

4. Objective Function:
   - The objective is to maximize the number of free rooms remained. This can be achieved by minimizing the number of rooms used.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - We can assume that the number of visitor groups is equal to the number of host rooms. This simplifies the problem and makes it more tractable.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Number of visitor groups, host rooms, and time slots
int: n_visitors; int: n_hosts; int: n_slots;

% Room capacities and number of hosts
array[1..n_hosts] of int: capacities; array[1..n_hosts] of int: hosts;

% Decision variable: schedule[visitor, host, slot]
array[1..n_visitors, 1..n_hosts, 1..n_slots] of var 0..1: schedule;

% Each visitor group must be assigned to exactly one host room in each time slot
constraint forall(v in 1..n_visitors, s in 1..n_slots) (
  sum(h in 1..n_hosts) (schedule[v, h, s]) = 1
);

% The total number of people in a host room in each time slot cannot exceed the room's capacity
constraint forall(h in 1..n_hosts, s in 1..n_slots) (
  sum(v in 1..n_visitors) (schedule[v, h, s]) <= capacities[h]
);

% A visitor group cannot attend the same host room twice
constraint forall(v in 1..n_visitors, h in 1..n_hosts) (
  sum(s in 1..n_slots) (schedule[v, h, s]) <= 1
);

% Two visitor groups should not meet more than once across the fair
constraint forall(v1 in 1..n_visitors, v2 in v1+1..n_visitors) (
  sum(h in 1..n_hosts, s in 1..n_slots) (schedule[v1, h, s] * schedule[v2, h, s]) <= 1
);

% The number of hosts in a room should not exceed the number of slots
constraint forall(h in 1..n_hosts) (
  sum(s in 1..n_slots) (sum(v in 1..n_visitors) (schedule[v, h, s])) <= hosts[h]
);

% Objective: minimize the number of rooms used
var int: rooms_used = sum(h in 1..n_hosts, s in 1..n_slots) (bool2int(sum(v in 1..n_visitors) (schedule[v, h, s]) > 0));
solve minimize rooms_used;
```

Note: This model assumes that the number of visitor groups is equal to the number of host rooms. If this is not the case, the model needs to be adjusted accordingly.
