**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - `is_host[i]`: Boolean variable indicating whether boat i is designated as a host
   - `visit[g,h,t]`: Boolean variable indicating whether guest boat g visits host boat h at time period t

2. **Parameters:**
   - Number of boats: 42
   - Number of time periods: 6
   - For each boat i: capacity[i] and crew_size[i] (given in the table)
   - Boats 40, 41, 42 have capacity 0, so they cannot be hosts

3. **Constraints:**
   - **Host designation**: A boat can only be visited if it's designated as a host
   - **Capacity constraint**: At any time period, the total people on a host boat (host crew + visiting guest crews) cannot exceed its capacity
   - **Guest boat scheduling**: Each guest boat must visit exactly one host in each time period
   - **No revisiting**: A guest boat cannot visit the same host more than once across all time periods
   - **Guest crews cannot meet twice**: If two guest boats visit the same host in one time period, they cannot visit the same host together in any other time period
   - **Boats with zero capacity cannot be hosts**: Boats 40, 41, 42 must be guests

4. **Objective Function:**
   - Minimize the total number of host boats (sum of is_host variables)

5. **Modeling Choices:**
   - Use 1-based indexing to match the boat numbering in the problem
   - The "guest crews cannot meet more than once" constraint is the most complex - we need to ensure that for any pair of guest boats, they don't visit the same host in more than one time period

**MiniZinc model:**

% Yacht Club Party Timetabling Problem
% Minimize the number of host boats while satisfying all constraints

% Parameters

% Decision variables
array[1..n_boats] of var bool: is_host;  % Whether boat i is a host
array[1..n_boats, 1..n_boats, 1..n_periods] of var bool: visit;  % guest g visits host h at time t

% Boats with zero capacity cannot be hosts

% A boat cannot visit itself
constraint forall(i in 1..n_boats, t in 1..n_periods) (
    visit[i,i,t] = false
);

% Can only visit designated hosts
constraint forall(g in 1..n_boats, h in 1..n_boats, t in 1..n_periods) (
    visit[g,h,t] -> is_host[h]
);

% Each guest boat visits exactly one host per time period
constraint forall(g in 1..n_boats, t in 1..n_periods where not is_host[g]) (
    sum(h in 1..n_boats) (visit[g,h,t]) = 1
);

% Host boats don't visit anyone (they stay on their boat)
constraint forall(g in 1..n_boats, h in 1..n_boats, t in 1..n_periods) (
    is_host[g] -> visit[g,h,t] = false
);

% Capacity constraint: total people on host boat cannot exceed capacity
constraint forall(h in 1..n_boats, t in 1..n_periods where is_host[h]) (
    crew_size[h] + sum(g in 1..n_boats) (visit[g,h,t] * crew_size[g]) <= capacity[h]
);

% No revisiting: a guest cannot visit the same host more than once
constraint forall(g in 1..n_boats, h in 1..n_boats) (
    sum(t in 1..n_periods) (visit[g,h,t]) <= 1
);

% Guest crews cannot meet more than once
constraint forall(g1, g2 in 1..n_boats where g1 < g2) (
    sum(h in 1..n_boats, t in 1..n_periods) (visit[g1,h,t] * visit[g2,h,t]) <= 1
);

% Objective: minimize number of host boats
var int: num_hosts = sum(i in 1..n_boats) (is_host[i]);

% Output
