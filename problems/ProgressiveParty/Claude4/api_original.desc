**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - `is_host[i]`: Boolean variable indicating whether boat i is designated as a host
   - `visit[g,h,t]`: Boolean variable indicating whether guest boat g visits host boat h at time period t
   - `meet[g1,g2]`: Boolean variable tracking whether guest crews g1 and g2 have met (to enforce they meet at most once)

2. **Domains:**
   - Boats: 1 to 42
   - Time periods: 1 to 6
   - `is_host[i]`: Boolean (0 or 1)
   - `visit[g,h,t]`: Boolean (0 or 1)
   - `meet[g1,g2]`: Boolean (0 or 1)

3. **Key Constraints:**
   - **Host/Guest separation**: A boat cannot be both host and guest
   - **Capacity constraints**: Total people on each host boat at each time period ≤ capacity
   - **Guest scheduling**: Each guest boat visits exactly one host per time period
   - **No revisiting**: A guest boat cannot visit the same host more than once
   - **Meeting constraint**: Guest crews can meet at most once (when visiting the same host at the same time)
   - **Zero-capacity boats**: Boats 40, 41, 42 have capacity 0, so they cannot be hosts

4. **Objective Function:**
   - Minimize the total number of host boats: `minimize sum(i in BOATS)(is_host[i])`

5. **Modeling Choices:**
   - Use symmetry breaking by ordering boats when possible
   - Handle the meeting constraint by tracking all pairs of guest boats
   - Ensure boats with zero capacity cannot be hosts

**MiniZinc model:**

```minizinc
% Yacht Club Party Timetabling Problem
% Minimize the number of host boats while satisfying all constraints

% Data
int: n_boats = 42;
int: n_periods = 6;
set of int: BOATS = 1..n_boats;
set of int: PERIODS = 1..n_periods;

% Boat data
array[BOATS] of int: capacity = [6,8,12,12,12,12,12,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,12,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,0,0,0];
array[BOATS] of int: crew_size = [2,2,2,2,4,4,4,1,2,2,2,3,4,2,3,6,2,2,4,2,4,5,4,4,2,2,4,5,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,5,7,2,3,4];

% Decision variables
array[BOATS] of var bool: is_host;  % Whether boat i is a host
array[BOATS, BOATS, PERIODS] of var bool: visit;  % Whether guest g visits host h at time t
array[BOATS, BOATS] of var bool: meet;  % Whether guest crews g1 and g2 have met

% Objective: minimize number of host boats
var int: num_hosts = sum(i in BOATS)(is_host[i]);
solve minimize num_hosts;

% Constraints

% 1. Boats with zero capacity cannot be hosts
constraint forall(i in BOATS where capacity[i] = 0)(
    is_host[i] = false
);

% 2. A boat cannot visit itself
constraint forall(g in BOATS, t in PERIODS)(
    visit[g, g, t] = false
);

% 3. A guest boat can only visit hosts
constraint forall(g, h in BOATS, t in PERIODS)(
    visit[g, h, t] -> is_host[h]
);

% 4. A host boat cannot visit other boats (hosts stay on their boats)
constraint forall(g, h in BOATS, t in PERIODS)(
    visit[g, h, t] -> not is_host[g]
);

% 5. Each guest boat visits exactly one host per time period
constraint forall(g in BOATS where not is_host[g])(
    forall(t in PERIODS)(
        sum(h in BOATS)(visit[g, h, t]) = 1
    )
);

% 6. Host boats don't visit anyone (they stay put)
constraint forall(g in BOATS where is_host[g])(
    forall(h in BOATS, t in PERIODS)(
        visit[g, h, t] = false
    )
);

% 7. Capacity constraints: total people on each host boat ≤ capacity
constraint forall(h in BOATS, t in PERIODS where is_host[h])(
    crew_size[h] + sum(g in BOATS)(visit[g, h, t] * crew_size[g]) <= capacity[h]
);

% 8. A guest boat cannot revisit the same host
constraint forall(g, h in BOATS)(
    sum(t in PERIODS)(visit[g, h, t]) <= 1
);

% 9. Guest crews can meet at most once
constraint forall(g1, g2 in BOATS where g1 < g2)(
    meet[g1, g2] = (sum(h in BOATS, t in PERIODS)(visit[g1, h, t] * visit[g2, h, t]) >= 1)
);

% 10. Symmetry breaking: if two boats have same capacity and crew size, order them
constraint forall(i, j in BOATS where i < j /\ capacity[i] = capacity[j] /\ crew_size[i] = crew_size[j])(
    is_host[i] >= is_host[j]
);

% Output
output [
    "Number of host boats: " ++ show(num_hosts) ++ "\n" ++
    "Host boats: " ++ show([i | i in BOATS where fix(is_host[i])]) ++ "\n"
];
