**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - `room_used[r]`: Boolean indicating if room r is used as a host room
   - `group_in_room[g, r, t]`: Boolean indicating if visitor group g is in host room r at time slot t
   - `num_groups`: Integer representing the total number of visitor groups (to be determined)

2. **Parameters:**
   - Rooms 1-42 with given capacities and host counts
   - Time slots (need to determine appropriate number)
   - Group sizes (need to be defined or made variable)

3. **Key Constraints:**
   - **Room capacity**: Total people in a room (hosts + visitors) â‰¤ room capacity
   - **Group assignment**: Each visitor group must be in exactly one room per time slot
   - **No repeat visits**: Each visitor group visits each host room at most once
   - **Limited group meetings**: Any two visitor groups meet in the same room at most once
   - **Room usage consistency**: If a room is used, it must have consistent host assignment

4. **Objective:**
   - Maximize the number of unused rooms (minimize `sum(room_used)`)

5. **Modeling Choices:**
   - Assume uniform group sizes for simplicity (can be made variable)
   - Use a reasonable number of time slots (e.g., 6-8 slots)
   - Only rooms with capacity > 0 can be host rooms

**MiniZinc model:**

% Parameters
int: num_rooms = 42;
int: num_time_slots = 6;  % Adjustable based on requirements
int: group_size = 4;      % Uniform group size assumption

% Room data
array[1..num_rooms] of int: capacity = [6,8,12,12,12,12,12,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,12,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,0,0,0];

% Valid rooms (capacity > 0)
set of int: valid_rooms = {r | r in 1..num_rooms where capacity[r] > 0};
int: num_valid_rooms = card(valid_rooms);

% Decision variables
array[valid_rooms] of var bool: room_used;
var 1..20: num_groups;  % Maximum reasonable number of groups
array[1..20, valid_rooms, 1..num_time_slots] of var bool: group_in_room;

% Constraint: Each group is in exactly one room per time slot
constraint forall(g in 1..num_groups, t in 1..num_time_slots) (
    sum(r in valid_rooms)(group_in_room[g, r, t]) = 1
);

% Constraint: Room capacity not exceeded
constraint forall(r in valid_rooms, t in 1..num_time_slots) (
    hosts[r] + group_size * sum(g in 1..num_groups)(group_in_room[g, r, t]) <= capacity[r]
);

% Constraint: Each group visits each room at most once
constraint forall(g in 1..num_groups, r in valid_rooms) (
    sum(t in 1..num_time_slots)(group_in_room[g, r, t]) <= 1
);

% Constraint: Two groups meet at most once
constraint forall(g1, g2 in 1..num_groups where g1 < g2) (
    sum(r in valid_rooms, t in 1..num_time_slots)(
        group_in_room[g1, r, t] * group_in_room[g2, r, t]
    ) <= 1
);

% Constraint: Room usage consistency
constraint forall(r in valid_rooms) (
    room_used[r] = (sum(g in 1..num_groups, t in 1..num_time_slots)(group_in_room[g, r, t]) > 0)
);

% Constraint: Groups can only be assigned to used rooms
constraint forall(g in 1..num_groups, r in valid_rooms, t in 1..num_time_slots) (
    group_in_room[g, r, t] -> room_used[r]
);

% Constraint: Ensure we have enough diversity - each group should visit multiple rooms
constraint forall(g in 1..num_groups) (
    sum(r in valid_rooms, t in 1..num_time_slots)(group_in_room[g, r, t]) >= min(num_time_slots, 3)
);

% Objective: Maximize free rooms (minimize used rooms)
solve minimize sum(r in valid_rooms)(room_used[r]);
