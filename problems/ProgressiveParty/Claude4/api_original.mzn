I notice you've provided a table of boats with their capacities and crew sizes, but you haven't specified what problem you'd like me to solve with this data. Could you please clarify what optimization or constraint satisfaction problem you want to model?

For example, are you looking to:
- Assign passengers to boats to maximize total capacity utilization?
- Select a subset of boats that meets certain requirements?
- Schedule boats for trips?
- Assign crew members to boats?
- Something else entirely?

Once you provide the problem description, I'll analyze the requirements step by step and create the appropriate MiniZinc model for you.
