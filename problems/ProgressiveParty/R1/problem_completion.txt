The problem is to timetable a party at a yacht club. Certain boats are to be designated hosts, and the crews of the remaining boats in turn visit the host boats for several successive half-hour periods. The crew of a host boat remains on board to act as hosts while the crew of a guest boat together visits several hosts. Every boat can only hold a limited number of people at a time (its capacity) and crew sizes are different. The total number of people aboard a boat, including the host crew and guest crews, must not exceed the capacity. A table with boat capacities and crew sizes can be found below; the problem is to determine which boats should be hosts and to schedule the visits of guest boats to host boats over the time periods such that the capacity of each host boat is not exceeded during any time period.
