### Reasoning

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling visitor groups to host rooms over multiple time slots while respecting constraints on room capacities, group movements, and interactions. The goal is to maximize the number of free rooms (i.e., rooms not used as hosts).

2. **Key Elements**:
   - **Rooms**: There are 42 rooms, each with a capacity and a number of hosts (facilitators). Effective capacity for a room is `capacity - hosts`. Rooms with effective capacity < 0 cannot be used as hosts.
   - **Visitor Groups**: There are `G` groups, each with a size `size[g]`. These groups rotate between host rooms over `T` time slots.
   - **Constraints**:
     - Each group must visit a different host room in each time slot (no repeated visits to the same room).
     - Any two groups must not meet more than once (i.e., they share the same host room in at most one time slot).
     - For each host room and time slot, the total size of groups assigned to that room must not exceed its effective capacity.
   - **Objective**: Maximize the number of free rooms (rooms not used as hosts).

3. **Modeling Decisions**:
   - **Variables**: 
     - `assign[g, t]`: The host room assigned to group `g` in time slot `t`.
     - `used_room[r]`: A binary variable indicating if room `r` is used as a host at least once.
   - **Constraints**:
     - `alldifferent` for each group across time slots.
     - Sum of coinciding assignments for any two groups is at most 1.
     - `used_room[r]` is forced to `false` for rooms with effective capacity < 0.
     - `used_room[r]` is defined based on assignments.
     - Capacity constraints are applied only to rooms with effective capacity â‰¥ 0.
   - **Objective**: Maximize `num_rooms - sum(used_room)`.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - The number of groups `G`, time slots `T`, and group sizes `size[1..G]` are provided as parameters.
   - Room capacities and hosts are fixed from the given table.

### MiniZinc Model

```minizinc
% Parameters for groups and time slots
int: G; % number of visitor groups
int: T; % number of time slots
array[1..G] of int: size; % size of each group

% Fixed room data
int: num_rooms = 42;
array[1..num_rooms] of int: capacity = [6,8,12,12,12,12,12,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,12,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,0,0,0];
array[1..num_rooms] of int: hosts = [2,2,2,2,4,4,4,1,2,2,2,3,4,2,3,6,2,2,4,2,4,5,4,4,2,2,4,5,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,5,7,2,3,4];

% Derived effective capacity
array[1..num_rooms] of int: E = [capacity[i] - hosts[i] | i in 1..num_rooms];

% Decision variables
array[1..G, 1..T] of var 1..num_rooms: assign; % room assigned to group g at time t
array[1..num_rooms] of var bool: used_room; % whether room r is used as a host

% Constraints

% Each group visits different rooms in different time slots
constraint forall(g in 1..G) (
    alldifferent([assign[g, t] | t in 1..T])
);

% Any two groups meet at most once
constraint forall(g1, g2 in 1..G where g1 < g2) (
    sum(t in 1..T) (assign[g1, t] == assign[g2, t]) <= 1
);

% Force used_room to false for rooms with effective capacity < 0
constraint forall(r in 1..num_rooms where E[r] < 0) (
    used_room[r] = false
);

% Define used_room: room r is used if assigned at least once
constraint forall(r in 1..num_rooms) (
    used_room[r] = (sum(g in 1..G, t in 1..T) (assign[g, t] == r) >= 1)
);

% Capacity constraint: for each room and time slot, total group size <= effective capacity
constraint forall(r in 1..num_rooms where E[r] >= 0, t in 1..T) (
    sum(g in 1..G) (size[g] * (assign[g, t] == r)) <= E[r]
);

% Objective: maximize free rooms
solve maximize num_rooms - sum(used_room);

% Output (optional)
output [
    "Assignments:\n",
    [ show(assign[g, t]) ++ if t == T then "\n" else " " endif | g in 1..G, t in 1..T ]
] ++ [
    "\nUsed rooms: " ++ show(used_room) ++
    "\nFree rooms: " ++ show(num_rooms - sum(used_room))
];
```
