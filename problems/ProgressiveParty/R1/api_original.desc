**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Overview**: The problem involves scheduling a party at a yacht club with 42 boats. Some boats are designated as hosts, and the remaining boats are guests. There are 6 time periods. Each guest boat visits one host boat per period, and cannot revisit the same host boat. Additionally, any two guest crews cannot meet more than once (i.e., they cannot be at the same host boat in more than one period). The goal is to minimize the number of host boats.

2. **Boats and Capacities**: Boats 1 to 39 have positive capacities and can be hosts. Boats 40, 41, and 42 have capacity 0 and must be guests. The capacities and crew sizes are given in arrays.

3. **Decision Variables**:
   - `is_host[b]` for each boat `b` (1..42): a Boolean variable indicating if boat `b` is a host. For boats 40-42, this is fixed to false.
   - `visit[b,t]` for each boat `b` and period `t`: the host boat that boat `b` is at during period `t`. For host boats, this is fixed to themselves; for guest boats, this must be a host boat.

4. **Constraints**:
   - **Host Assignment**: Boats 40-42 are not hosts.
   - **Visit Assignment**: For each boat and period, if it is a host, `visit[b,t] = b`; otherwise, `visit[b,t]` must be a host boat (i.e., `is_host[visit[b,t]]` is true).
   - **No Revisit**: For each guest boat, the hosts visited across periods must all be different (enforced with `alldifferent`).
   - **No Meet Twice**: For any two distinct guest boats, the number of periods where they visit the same host is at most one.
   - **Capacity**: For each host boat and period, the total crew size of all boats at that host (including the host itself) must not exceed the host's capacity.

5. **Objective**: Minimize the number of host boats from 1 to 39 (since boats 40-42 cannot be hosts).

6. **Modeling Notes**: The model uses constraints with conditionals to handle the dynamic sets of hosts and guests. The capacity constraint sums crew sizes for all boats at a host, which automatically includes the host crew. The no-meet-twice constraint is applied only to pairs of guest boats.

% Constraint: Boats 40,41,42 are not hosts

% Constraint: No revisit for guest boats - each guest visits different hosts across periods

% Objective: Minimize the number of host boats (from 1 to 39)
