**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Overview**: The goal is to schedule a party with boats as hosts or guests over six time periods, minimizing the number of host boats. Host boats stay on board, while guest boats visit hosts each period. Constraints include capacity limits, distinct host visits per guest, and guest crews meeting at most once.

2. **Key Elements**:
   - There are 42 boats, each with a capacity and crew size.
   - Boats with capacity 0 (40,41,42) cannot be hosts and must be guests.
   - Each guest boat must visit a different host in each of the six periods.
   - The total people on a host boat in any period (host crew plus guest crews) must not exceed its capacity.
   - For any two guest boats, they share the same host in at most one period.

3. **Decision Variables**:
   - `is_host[i]`: Boolean variable for each boat i, true if it is a host.
   - `assign[i,t]`: Integer variable for each boat i and period t, indicating the host boat assigned to i in period t. For hosts, `assign[i,t] = i`.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Boats 40,41,42 must not be hosts.
   - For hosts, `assign[i,t] = i` for all periods.
   - For guests, `assign[i,t]` must be a host boat.
   - Each guest must visit distinct hosts over the six periods.
   - For any two guests, the number of periods with the same host assignment is at most one.
   - For each host and period, the sum of crew sizes assigned to it must not exceed its capacity.

5. **Objective**: Minimize the number of host boats (`sum(is_host)`).

6. **Modeling Notes**:
   - The assignment variable `assign[i,t]` is defined for all boats and periods, simplifying constraints by using `assign[i,t] = i` for hosts.
   - Capacity constraints are applied to all boats, but only hosts have non-zero assignments due to other constraints.
   - The meeting constraint is applied only to pairs of guest boats.

**MiniZinc Model:**

% Boats: 1 to 42
set of int: BOATS = 1..42;
% Number of time periods
int: periods = 6;
set of int: PERIODS = 1..periods;

% Capacity and crew size arrays

% Decision variables

array[BOATS, PERIODS] of var BOATS: assign;

% Constraints

% Boats with capacity 0 cannot be hosts
constraint forall(i in {40,41,42}) (not is_host[i]);

% For hosts, assign[i,t] = i for all periods
% For guests, assign[i,t] must be a host boat
constraint forall(i in BOATS, t in PERIODS) (
    if is_host[i] then
        assign[i,t] == i
    else
        is_host[assign[i,t]]
    endif
);

% Each guest must visit distinct hosts over periods
constraint forall(i in BOATS) (
    if not is_host[i] then
        all_different([assign[i,t] | t in PERIODS])
    else
        true
    endif
);

% Guest crews meet at most once: for any two guests, same host in at most one period
constraint forall(i,j in BOATS where i < j) (
    (not is_host[i] /\ not is_host[j]) -> 
    sum(t in PERIODS) (assign[i,t] == assign[j,t]) <= 1
);

% Capacity constraint: for each boat and period, total crew assigned must not exceed capacity
constraint forall(h in BOATS, t in PERIODS) (
    sum(i in BOATS) (crew[i] * (assign[i,t] == h)) <= capacity[h]
);

% Objective: minimize number of host boats
solve minimize sum(i in BOATS) (is_host[i]);

% Output: show the host boats and assignments for guests
output [
    "Host boats: " ++ show([i | i in BOATS where fix(is_host[i])]) ++ "\n"
] ++ [
    "Assignment for period " ++ show(t) ++ ": " ++ 
    show([if fix(is_host[i]) then "host" else show(assign[i,t]) endif | i in BOATS]) ++ "\n"
