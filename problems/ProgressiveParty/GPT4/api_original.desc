Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - `host[i]`: A binary variable for each boat `i` that indicates whether it is a host or not.
   - `visit[i,j,t]`: A binary variable for each boat `i`, host `j`, and time period `t` that indicates whether boat `i` visits host `j` at time `t`.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of `host[i]` is `{0,1}`.
   - The domain of `visit[i,j,t]` is `{0,1}`.

3. Constraints:
   - A boat cannot visit itself.
   - The total number of people on a host boat at any time period must not exceed its capacity.
   - A guest boat cannot revisit a host.
   - Guest crews cannot meet more than once.
   - A boat can only be a host if its capacity is greater than its crew size.
   - A boat can only visit a host if the host's capacity is greater than the boat's crew size.

4. Objective Function:
   - The objective is to minimize the number of host boats.

5. Simplifications/Modeling Choices:
   - We can model the problem as a binary integer programming problem.
   - We can use the sum of the `host` variables as the objective function.
   - We can use the `sum` function to enforce the capacity constraints.
   - We can use the `forall` function to enforce the visitation constraints.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Number of boats and time periods
int: n = 42;
int: t = 6;

% Boat capacities and crew sizes
array[1..n] of int: capacity = [6,8,12,12,12,12,12,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,12,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,0,0,0];
array[1..n] of int: crew = [2,2,2,2,4,4,4,1,2,2,2,3,4,2,3,6,2,2,4,2,4,5,4,4,2,2,4,5,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,5,7,2,3,4];

% Decision variables
array[1..n] of var 0..1: host;
array[1..n, 1..n, 1..t] of var 0..1: visit;

% Constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..n) (
  host[i] = 1 -> capacity[i] > crew[i]
);
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in 1..n, k in 1..t) (
  visit[i,j,k] = 1 -> (host[j] = 1 /\ i != j /\ capacity[j] > crew[i])
);
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in 1..n) (
  sum(k in 1..t) (visit[i,j,k]) <= 1
);
constraint forall(i in 1..n, k in 1..t) (
  sum(j in 1..n) (visit[i,j,k]) <= 1
);
constraint forall(j in 1..n, k in 1..t) (
  sum(i in 1..n) (visit[i,j,k]*crew[i]) <= capacity[j] - crew[j]*host[j]
);

% Objective function
var int: num_hosts = sum(i in 1..n) (host[i]);
solve minimize num_hosts;
