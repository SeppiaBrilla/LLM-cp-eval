**Reasoning**

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves scheduling visitor groups to host rooms over multiple time slots. The goal is to maximize the number of free rooms (rooms not used as hosts) while respecting constraints: room capacities, group sizes, no group visits the same host room twice, and no two groups meet more than once. The "hosts" column in the data is not used in this model due to ambiguity, but room capacities are crucial.

2. **Key Elements**:
   - Rooms: 42 rooms with given capacities. Rooms with capacity 0 cannot be host rooms.
   - Visitor groups: G groups, each with a size (number of people).
   - Time slots: T time slots.
   - Host rooms: A subset of rooms is selected as host rooms. Host rooms may have no groups in some time slots.

3. **Decision Variables**:
   - `use[r]`: Binary variable for each room r, indicating if it is a host room.
   - `assign[g,t]`: Integer variable for each group g and time slot t, indicating the host room assigned.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Rooms with capacity 0 cannot be host rooms.
   - All assignments must be to host rooms.
   - Each group visits distinct host rooms over time.
   - Any two groups meet at most once (i.e., are in the same host room at the same time slot at most once).
   - For each time slot and room, the total size of groups assigned must not exceed the room's capacity.

5. **Objective**: Maximize the number of free rooms (i.e., rooms not used as hosts).

6. **Parameters**: T (time slots), G (groups), and group sizes are input parameters. Room capacities are fixed from the provided data.

7. **Assumptions**:
   - The "hosts" column is omitted due to unclear relevance.
   - "Meet" means being in the same host room at the same time slot.
   - Each group attends one host room per time slot.

**MiniZinc model**
```minizinc
% Parameters
int: T; % Number of time slots
int: G; % Number of visitor groups
array[1..G] of int: size; % Size of each visitor group
int: R = 42; % Number of rooms
array[1..R] of int: cap = [6,8,12,12,12,12,12,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,12,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,0,0,0]; % Capacity of each room

% Decision variables
array[1..R] of var bool: use; % use[r] = true if room r is a host room
array[1..G, 1..T] of var 1..R: assign; % assign[g,t] = host room for group g at time t

% Constraints
% Rooms with capacity 0 cannot be host rooms
constraint forall(r in 1..R where cap[r] == 0) (use[r] == false);

% Assignments must be to host rooms
constraint forall(g in 1..G, t in 1..T) (use[assign[g,t]] == true);

% Each group visits distinct host rooms over time
constraint forall(g in 1..G) (alldifferent([assign[g,t] | t in 1..T]));

% Two groups meet at most once
constraint forall(g1, g2 in 1..G where g1 < g2) (
    sum(t in 1..T) (assign[g1,t] == assign[g2,t]) <= 1
);

% Capacity constraint for each room and time slot
constraint forall(t in 1..T, r in 1..R) (
    sum(g in 1..G) (if assign[g,t] == r then size[g] else 0 endif) <= cap[r]
);

% Objective: maximize number of free rooms
solve maximize sum(r in 1..R) (1 - bool2int(use[r]));

% Output (optional)
output [

    "Host rooms: ", show([r | r in 1..R where use[r]]), "\n",
