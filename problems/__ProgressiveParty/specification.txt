The problem is to timetable a party at a yacht club. Certain boats are to be designated hosts, and the crews of the remaining boats in turn visit the host boats for several successive half-hour periods. The crew of a host boat remains on board to act as hosts while the crew of a guest boat together visits several hosts. Every boat can only hold a limited number of people at a time (its capacity) and crew sizes are different. The total number of people aboard a boat, including the host crew and guest crews, must not exceed the capacity. A table with boat capacities and crew sizes can be found below; there were six time periods. A guest boat cannot not revisit a host and guest crews cannot meet more than once. The problem facing the rally organizer is that of minimizing the number of host boats.

A university is organizing an academic networking fair. Certain classrooms are designated as hosts, where sessions are held, while the remaining groups of participants rotate as visitors between host rooms over several successive half-hour slots.
The facilitators assigned to host rooms remain fixed, while visitor groups move from one host room to another across the schedule. Each room has a maximum seating capacity, and the people in a session cannot exceed that room’s capacity. Group sizes differ, and each group must experience a diverse set of sessions.
Furthermore, a visitor group cannot attend the same host room twice and two visitor groups should not meet more than once across the fair.
The organizer’s challenge is to design a feasible schedule that respects room capacities, group sizes, and session rules, while maximising the number of free rooms remained (we assume to have all necessary rooms but we want to leave as many free room as possible).
