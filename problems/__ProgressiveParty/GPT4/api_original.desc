Reasoning:

1. Decision Variables:
   - A binary variable `host[i]` for each boat `i` to indicate whether it is a host or not.
   - A binary variable `visit[i,j,t]` for each boat `i`, `j` and time period `t` to indicate whether boat `i` visits boat `j` at time `t`.

2. Domains:
   - The domain of `host[i]` is `{0,1}` where `1` indicates that boat `i` is a host and `0` otherwise.
   - The domain of `visit[i,j,t]` is `{0,1}` where `1` indicates that boat `i` visits boat `j` at time `t` and `0` otherwise.

3. Constraints:
   - A boat can only visit another boat if the other boat is a host.
   - A boat cannot visit itself.
   - The total number of people on a boat at any time period must not exceed its capacity.
   - A guest boat cannot revisit a host.
   - Guest crews cannot meet more than once.

4. Objective Function:
   - The objective is to minimize the number of host boats.

5. Simplifications or Modeling Choices:
   - We can assume that the number of time periods is fixed and known in advance.
   - We can also assume that the capacities and crew sizes of the boats are fixed and known in advance.

MiniZinc model:

```minizinc
% Parameters
int: n = 42; % number of boats
int: t = 6; % number of time periods
array[1..n] of int: capacity = [6,8,12,12,12,12,12,10,10,10,10,10,8,8,8,12,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,0,0,0]; % capacity of each boat
array[1..n] of int: crew_size = [2,2,2,2,4,4,4,1,2,2,2,3,4,2,3,6,2,2,4,2,4,5,4,4,2,2,4,5,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,5,7,2,3,4]; % crew size of each boat

% Decision Variables
array[1..n] of var 0..1: host; % whether each boat is a host
array[1..n, 1..n, 1..t] of var 0..1: visit; % whether each boat visits another boat at each time period

% Constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in 1..n, k in 1..t) (
  visit[i,j,k] <= host[j] % a boat can only visit another boat if the other boat is a host
);

constraint forall(i in 1..n, k in 1..t) (
  visit[i,i,k] = 0 % a boat cannot visit itself
);

constraint forall(j in 1..n, k in 1..t) (
  sum(i in 1..n) (visit[i,j,k] * crew_size[i]) + host[j] * crew_size[j] <= capacity[j] % the total number of people on a boat at any time period must not exceed its capacity
);

constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in 1..n) (
  sum(k in 1..t) (visit[i,j,k]) <= 1 % a guest boat cannot revisit a host
);

constraint forall(i in 1..n, k in 1..t) (
  sum(j in 1..n) (visit[i,j,k]) <= 1 % a guest boat can only visit one host at a time
);

constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in 1..n) (
  sum(k in 1..t) (visit[i,j,k] + visit[j,i,k]) <= 1 % guest crews cannot meet more than once
);

% Objective
var int: num_hosts = sum(i in 1..n) (host[i]);
solve minimize num_hosts;
