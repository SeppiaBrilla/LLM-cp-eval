The problem is to timetable a party at a yacht club. Certain boats are to be designated hosts, and the crews of the remaining boats in turn visit the host boats for several successive half-hour periods. The crew of a host boat remains on board to act as hosts while the crew of a guest boat together visits several hosts. Every boat can only hold a limited number of people at a time (its capacity) and crew sizes are different. The total number of people aboard a boat, including the host crew and guest crews, must not exceed the capacity. A table with boat capacities and crew sizes can be found below; the objective is to create a schedule that ensures each guest crew visits each host boat exactly once during the party, while respecting all capacity constraints and ensuring that no guest crew is split up during any time period.
