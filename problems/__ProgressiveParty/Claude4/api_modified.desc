**Reasoning:**

1. **Decision Variables:**
   - `used[r]`: Boolean variable indicating whether room `r` is used as a host room
   - `schedule[g, t, r]`: Boolean variable indicating whether visitor group `g` is in room `r` at time slot `t`
   - `host_assignment[r, h]`: Boolean variable indicating whether host `h` is assigned to room `r`

2. **Domains:**
   - Rooms: 1 to 42 (though rooms 40-42 have capacity 0, so effectively unusable)
   - Time slots: We need to determine this based on the problem structure
   - Visitor groups: We need to infer this from the host counts and problem constraints
   - Hosts: We can count unique hosts from the data (1 to 7)

3. **Key Constraints:**
   - Room capacity: Total people in a room (hosts + visitors) â‰¤ room capacity
   - Each visitor group attends exactly one room per time slot
   - No visitor group visits the same host room twice
   - No two visitor groups meet more than once across all sessions
   - Each used room must have its designated number of hosts assigned
   - Host assignment consistency: if a room is used, it must have the correct number of hosts

4. **Objective:**
   - Maximize the number of unused rooms (minimize the number of used rooms)

5. **Problem Analysis:**
   - We have 7 different hosts and varying host requirements per room
   - We need to determine appropriate number of time slots and visitor groups
   - The constraint that "two visitor groups should not meet more than once" is complex and requires careful modeling
   - We need to assume reasonable values for number of visitor groups and time slots

6. **Modeling Choices:**
   - Assume 6 time slots and 8 visitor groups of size 3 each (these can be adjusted)
   - Model the "meeting constraint" by tracking which pairs of groups are in the same room

**MiniZinc model:**

% Objective: maximize free rooms (minimize used rooms)
var int: objective = sum(r in 1..num_rooms)(used[r]);

% Constraints

% 1. Room capacity constraint
constraint forall(r in 1..num_rooms, t in 1..num_time_slots)(
    if used[r] then
        required_hosts[r] + visitor_group_size * sum(g in 1..num_visitor_groups)(schedule[g,t,r]) <= capacity[r]
    else
        sum(g in 1..num_visitor_groups)(schedule[g,t,r]) = 0
    endif
);

% 2. Each visitor group attends exactly one room per time slot
constraint forall(g in 1..num_visitor_groups, t in 1..num_time_slots)(
    sum(r in 1..num_rooms)(schedule[g,t,r]) = 1
);

% 3. No visitor group visits the same room twice
constraint forall(g in 1..num_visitor_groups, r in 1..num_rooms)(
    sum(t in 1..num_time_slots)(schedule[g,t,r]) <= 1
);

% 4. Define when groups meet
constraint forall(g1, g2 in 1..num_visitor_groups, t in 1..num_time_slots, r in 1..num_rooms where g1 < g2)(
    groups_meet[g1,g2,t,r] <-> (schedule[g1,t,r] /\ schedule[g2,t,r])
);

% 5. No two visitor groups meet more than once
constraint forall(g1, g2 in 1..num_visitor_groups where g1 < g2)(
    sum(t in 1..num_time_slots, r in 1..num_rooms)(groups_meet[g1,g2,t,r]) <= 1
);

% 6. Room usage consistency
constraint forall(r in 1..num_rooms)(
    used[r] <-> exists(g in 1..num_visitor_groups, t in 1..num_time_slots)(schedule[g,t,r])
);

% 7. Don't use rooms with zero capacity
constraint forall(r in 1..num_rooms where capacity[r] = 0)(
    used[r] = false
);

% 8. Ensure minimum viable sessions (at least some groups must be scheduled)
constraint sum(g in 1..num_visitor_groups, t in 1..num_time_slots, r in 1..num_rooms)(schedule[g,t,r]) >= num_visitor_groups * num_time_slots;
